Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 3D Lattice Boltzmann Method can provide a high fidelity description
 of sound-flow interactions and will therefore be applied to an in-depth
 analysis of the slat noise mechanisms.
 The ProLB solver with its advanced functionalities enable the recording
 of the flow field to sufficient resolution such that the turbulent structures
 and their dynamics in the cove can be visualized with great detail.
 Hence this chapter is dedicated to our investigation of the cove flow phenomena
 using the data collected during our simulation of a well documented experiment
 carried out in the European project VALIANT.
 This data is used to optimize the simulation and to validate it.
 The configuration is that of a 2 element geometry designed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 as detailed in Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, here with only the standard positioning of the slat with respect to the
 main element.
 This configuration has the slat coordinates [
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Angle of Attack - }AOA=18.0^{o},\text{Slat Deflection Angle - }SDA=35.2\,\text{mm},\text{Slat Gap - }SGP=7.94\,\text{mm},\text{Slat Overlap - }SOL=-6.36\,\text{mm}]$
\end_inset

 and will be referred to as the reference configuration.

The cove vortex dynamics has been studied to great detail using LES and
 RANS simulations and also by experimental investigations in the literature

.
 The most agreed upon explanation of the characteristic slat noise is due
 to the presence of spanwise coherent vortices which are formed in the early
 shear layer near the slat cusp.
 These vortices are then convected towards the slat trailing edge where
 they undergo collision with the slat wall and deform such that their spanwise
 coherence is lost
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Manoha2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As a consequence, the ejected vortices has majorly streamwise orientation
 with only a portion of the spanwise coherence retained to cause the generation
 of acoustic waves which can close the aeroacoustic resonance loop
\color black
.
 In how much of this spanwise coherence can be retained at the impingement
 location is thus the determining factor for the presence of Rossiter tones
 and their strengths.
 Nevertheless, the mechanism of disintegration of the spanwise coherent
 structures are not studied widely and hence their effect on the noise generatio
n is not fully understood.

Our investigation in this direction lead to the fact that the curved shape

The behavior of a curved shear also lead us to investigate the three dimensional
ity of the dynamics.
 Here, the curved shear layer acting as a boundary for a recirculating cavity
 has spanwise modulations which are known to have additional low frequency
 oscillations.
 Our investigation of the same in the cove recirculation region lead to
 uncover the formation of large scale spanwise structures.
 This showed that the spanwise modulations in the slat cove are not only
 at the scales of the small scale streamwise eddies formed at impingement
 but also at scales comparable to the slat chord length, leading to the
 formation of steady spanwise cells within the recirculation region.
 These cell formations were not known apriori in the case of slat cove dynamics
 although traces of the same can be noted as part of visualizations of cove
 vortices in the works of

 In the current chapter, we attempt to use the LBM solver to demonstrate
 the presence of this phenomena in the standard geometry and attempt to
 establish a relationship between the spanwise cell formation and the shape
 of the shear layer.

\begin_layout Standard
To begin, we first validate the simulation framework for aeroacoustic computatio
ns by comparing its accuracy against experimental data using a standard
 geometry in a free-stream configuration.
 This serves as the baseline for the validation process.
 Next, we examine a case that includes the full installation effects and
 explain the differences observed in the results.
 Additionally, we present further simulation results based on variations
 of the same geometry, including one where the inlet velocity is reduced
 and another where the spanwise length of the simulation domain is shortened.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Additionally we also include a few additional results from simulations of
 related cases to the same geometry, first by including the wind tunnel
 geometry and lateral side walls, second by reducing the inlet velocity
 and a third by reducing the spanwise length of the simulation domain, all
 demonstrating formation of the spanwise modulations independent of these
 parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In all of these cases, the three dimensionality is observed, demonstrating
 that such modulations occur independently of these parameters.

\begin_layout Standard
The results from validation case study detailed in the previous chapter
 based on the free stream conditions are detailed in this section.
 The convergence of the unsteady dynamics and mean wall pressure distributions
 are canonical measures of fidelity for the simulation and are discussed
 first.
 Subsequently, the probe data recordings are analyzed and finally the FWH
 computations are discussed to validate the aeroacoustic capabilities of
 the solver.

An accurate capture of the flow dynamics and quantitative accuracies of
 the acoustic source phenomena are necessary to obtain a good agreement
 with experimental data.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Convergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In LBM simulations the convergence is checked primarily by using the unsteady
 data recorded using numerical probes in the simulation.
 This is due to the fact that unlike conventional solvers, the LBM approach
 calculates a simulation time step without iterative procedures
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Feng2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Hence a useful monitor for the stationarity of the simulated aerodynamics
 is the unsteady forces on the solid geometries.
 ProLB enable users to integrate the surface forces over the solid wall
 geometries using native functions and is deployed to extract the results.
 The force components which are in the direction of the X coordinate axis
 are taken to be the drag force and the one in Y direction is taken to be
 the lift force.
 This directionality are not exactly accurate since the angle of attack
 of the main element is not aligned with the coordinate axes.
 Nevertheless, for convergence monitoring the directionality is not relevant.
 The recordings obtained are shown in Fig.

 The unsteady loading show satisfactory convergence after a total physical
 time of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05\,\text{s}$

 and the mean values are steady after 
\begin_inset Formula $0.075\,\text{s}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
A second monitor is the unsteady data from critical locations of the flow.
 Here the slat cove dynamics can be monitored using the wall pressure sensor
 data.
 Raw data from a sensor placed inside the slat cove is shown in Fig.

 As can be noted, there is a general agreement of the 
\begin_inset Formula $-C_{p}$
\end_inset

 distribution.
 However, the suction pressure on the slat is slightly higher in the simulation
 whereas it is lower for the main element as compared to experiment.
 This difference owes to the fact that in the experiment the wind-tunnel
 installation has additional features including the finite width jet.
 The static pressure over the airfoil also causes a potential effect which
 interferes with the wind tunnel jet exit to modify the exit pressure distributi
on.

The difference of angle of attack for the experiment and the simulation
 is also a factor affecting the pressure distribution.
 For the experiment, the airfoil is kept at 
\begin_inset Formula $25^{o}$
\end_inset

 to the jet exit direction and for the corresponding simulation in free
 stream condition, the angle of attack is reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $18^{o}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a method to correct the change in effective deflection.
 The equivalent angle of attack between the free stream case and the wind
 tunnel case was obtained empirically by matching the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 distributions from the free stream RANS simulations and actual experimental
 values, done by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The VALIANT HLD geometry was also obtained by replacing the flap of the
 base three-element configuration with a sharp trailing edge by keeping
 this equivalence of the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 distribution.
 Hence the same angle of attack of 
\begin_inset Formula $18^{o}$
\end_inset

 with the free stream is maintained for our comparison with the experiment
 as well.

The discrepancies related to difference of configurations are alleviated
 to a good extend if the simulation setup includes the full wind tunnel
 installation geometries.

The pressure on the main-element also shows a spatially local sharp peak
 which owes to the acceleration of the flow in the nozzle like shape of
 the slat gap.
 This feature is more prominent in the simulation since continuous data
 over the airfoil wall is available.
 This acceleration is responsible for the high velocity ejection of the
 slat turbulence from the slat trailing edge and hence is likely to drive
 both the characteristic low frequency broadband noise and the high frequency
 noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The case with the inclusion of the wind-tunnel shows a better agreement
 with the experiment for the attacking surface of the slat.
 This is due to the better capturing of the potential effect due to the
 airfoil near the nozzle exit where the exit flow is not uniform across
 the cross flow direction.
 In the full configuration simulation, the static pressure was not measured
 and the velocity was also not uniform, but with minor fluctuations (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1\,\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

 which has no measurable effect on the static pressure).
 This might be due to the fact that the static pressure is globally underestimat
ed in the free-field simulation.
 Hence the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 value at the leading edge of the main element can be seen to be weaker
 in the same case.

\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, the suction pressure on both the slat and the main element is higher
 in the experiment suggesting that the total lift is higher in the experimental
 setup.
 This discrepancy is due to the uniform inflow conditions in the free stream
 simulation.

Although not conclusively, the acceleration is also responsible for the
 local disintegration of spanwise coherent vorticity which upon impingement
 drives the Rossiter oscillations.
 The differences of the

 hence can explain the difference of the generated noise in case of free
 flow from the experiment such that in the experiment, the suction peak
 is observed to be stronger and hence leading to stronger broadband noise

The experiment tend to have the highest lift load owing to the fact that
 the HLD generates a strong deflection of the narrow width jet, thereby
 generating a strong lift.
 In the simulations, both ones with and without the wind tunnel, the lift

 (not all harmonics) along with consistently higher broadband SPL in simulations.
 A higher SPL suggests that the pressure fluctuations in the cove are more
 energetic in the simulations than the experiment.

Hot-wire probes

The hot-wire probe provides velocity data in flow-critical locations allowing

.
 The experiment and simulation which includes the wind tunnel installation
 geometries tend to have a better agreement of the average velocity data.
 In both cases, the velocity recovers the free stream velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $50\,\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

 and shows a mean recirculation velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $8\,\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

 on the cove side.
 In comparison, the flow in free stream simulation tends to develop a slightly
 weaker shear layer, with the free stream velocity recovering to 
\begin_inset Formula $43\,\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

 and the inner cove recirculation to 
\begin_inset Formula $12\,\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

.
 The velocity ratio between the inner and outer flows, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U_{i}}{U_{o}}$
\end_inset

, is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $0.16$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.27$
\end_inset

 for wind-tunnel and free stream simulation respectively.
 This suggests that a perfect capturing of the shear layer thickness and
 strength requires the presence of the full installation.

A few factors can explain this disparity.
 In the free stream simulation, the incoming flow is homogeneous and laminar.
 Hence the boundary layer and the turbulence therein are developed locally
 and spontaneous.
 On the contrary, the incoming flow in the experimental setup and its simulation
 has multiple sources of turbulence upstream of the HLD, i.e.
 the shear layer of the nozzle generates a shedding of vorticity and spanwise
 plates that support the HLD develops a fully turbulent boundary layer upstream
 of the HLD.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The corner flow then allows this vorticity to be convected into the spanwise
 extend.
 From studying the mean flow field, only 
\begin_inset Formula $20\%$
\end_inset

 of the spanwise extend can be seen to the fairly unaffected by the corner
 flow and the rest of the spanwise extend is strongly turbulent.
 These differences between the free stream simulation and the experiment
 hence affect the vorticity thickness of the shear layer and hence the strength
 of shear layer.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The velocity ratio across the shear layer has an important role in determining
 the dynamics of the flow especially the acoustics.
 Among many, the primary effect is that it determines the strength of the
 Rossiter mechanism.
 The shed vorticity from the cusp leads to the generation of the spanwise
 coherent eddies which excite the resonance and hence a reduction of the
 shear strength will weaken the generated vorticity, eventually weakening
 the resonance.
 As will be shown next, this can be one influential factor leading to the
 diminished strength of the first tone in the free stream simulation as
 compared to the experiment.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another important aspect is that the velocity ratio may affect the strength
 of the centrifugal effect arising from the shear layer curvature and the
 recirculation.
 A detailed study of this aspect is presented in the chapter following this
 one and hence we restrict to a short mention.
 The centrifugal effect which is reasoned to the be driver of the spanwise
 mode formations inside the cove and its associated secondary low frequency
 fluctuations are linked to the difference between the inner cove flow and
 the outer high speed flow.
 The Strouhal number of these fluctuations leads the periodic disruption
 of coherence of the shed vorticity and hence modulates the first Rossiter
 modes via amplitude modulation.
 Hence, to maintain fidelity regarding the secondary flow and the acoustic
 features inside the cove, capturing the velocity ratio is important.
 Nevertheless, this secondary flow features and a possible amplitude modulation
 is a novel finding during this work and hence the numerical framework was
 not initially designed particularly to maintain fidelity regarding centrifugal
 effects and it must be so for future investigations.
 For the current study, the free stream flow is noted to have a difference
 of strength of the shear layer and recirculation, and is related to the
 differences obtained in the predicted acoustic spectra.
 Consequently, we proceed this thesis with this understanding of these possible
 disparities and utilize the compute optimizations obtained from a free
 stream configuration in comparison compared to a full scale simulation,
 for a more extensive parametric investigation of the cove flow phenomena.

Given that the unsteady dynamics has many features worthy of further exploration
, it is important to understand the time-averaged fields in tandem.
 The mean flow field convects the fluid and its vortices to establish the
 macro-flow features like the accelerated flow through the slat gap and
 the recirculation region.
 Within this configuration, the unsteadiness can be thought to be introduced
 by the generation of vorticity due to the presence of slat cusp or the
 shear layer.
 These vortices then develop unsteady dynamics which leads to the aeroacoustics.
 Hence the vortex dynamics itself is intrinsically first determined by the
 established mean flow.

 The region of impingement is distinctly identifiable as a region of high
 pressure due to the partial stagnation of the flow and hence the reduction

 is not exactly at the center of recirculation itself but shifted nearer

The spanwise modulations and their obscurity in slat noise literature lead
 us to many interesting thoughts of which the following three are worthy
 of mention:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First is that the alternating time-averaged spanwise velocity cells means
 that there exist static nodal planes towards which the flow can converge
 and diverge from.
 Those planes whose both sides have spanwise velocity such that it decreases
 from positive to negative along the spanwise direction and hence have the
 flow directed towards the plane will be referred to as the `converging
 plane'.
 The other type of planes where the spanwise velocity increases from negative
 to positive necessitating the flow to diverge from the plane are the `diverging
 planes'.
 Since these planes act as sources and sinks for the spanwise dynamics,
 they must facilitate the interaction of the spanwise dynamics with the
 2-dimensional dynamics in the streamwise direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Second is that if such nodal planes exist, it is necessary that there must
 exist a mechanism to redistribute the fluid from the converging planes
 and to replenish the diverging planes continuously to establish a steady
 dynamics.
 Here, we have already seen that the recirculating small scale streamwise
 vortices are absorbed into the shear layer in regions near the mid trajectory.
 This suggests that for a converging plane, the mechanism to redistribute
 the fluid is by entrainment of the flow along with the streamwise structures
 into the shear layer, which must also lead to higher concentration (spanwise)
 of streamwise structures at the locations of the converging planes.
 There must also be a lower concentration of the streamwise structures in
 the diverging planes.
 Nevertheless, this may not be a phenomena easily observed in a largely
 turbulent state at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=10^{6}$
\end_inset

 with constant generation, distortion, and redistribution of vorticity,
 as in the slat cove.

 Their work demonstrated the existence of large scale spanwise modulations
 in the shear layer due to the presence of a backward facing step, and argues
 that the spanwise modulations are the result of an absolute convective
 instability owing to the closed loop streamline in the recirculation bubble
 leading to generation of steady spanwise modes.
 The eigen functions identified in their work using the linear stability
 analysis of a simplified flow configuration predicts the spanwise wavelength
 with same order as that of the cavity depth.
 This is consistent with the observation that the spanwise cells in the
 slat cove have a wavelength with same order as the slat chord.
 On comparing the rectangular flow cavity with the slat cove, the cavity
 depth is analogous to the diameter of the recirculating cove flow, and
 this diameter is approximately the slat chord.
 Their study also suggest a critical Reynolds number, although at a low
 range of 
\begin_inset Formula $Re_{c}=748$
\end_inset

, from which the spanwise modulations are dominant and this critical Reynolds
 number is also argued to be decreased when a lateral side wall is present.
 In the case of simulations with spanwise periodic conditions mimicking
 an infinite spanwise domain, the critical Reynolds number is also increased.
 The case of slat cove dynamics is at a Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 based on the mean flow and if considering the flow inside the cove region,
 taking the mean velocity to be 
\begin_inset Formula $20\,\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

, and the characteristic length scale to be the slat chord, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}=0.039\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

, corresponding Reynolds number is at 
\begin_inset Formula $54000$
\end_inset

.
 This regime is still two orders of magnitude higher than that required
 to trigger the convective instability
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The presence of spanwise walls are also of much importance for the slat
 cove flow as well, since, in our simulations we employ periodic conditions,
 and in experimental studies the lateral side walls are necessary to support
 the HLD mockup in the wind tunnel.
 Hence, drawing parallels between the fact that the flow over a backward
 facing step is much similar to the cove flow, particularly due to the fact
 that both cases have one side bounded by a shear layer and both have a
 recirculation bubble in which the spanwise modes tend to dominate, we suspect
 the same mechanism is also in action in the slat cove dynamics.

 For the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Neary1987"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, three regimes of flow for an open rectangular cavity based on the Reynold's
 number was identified.
 In the first, there is a strong interaction of the shear layer with the
 recirculating vortex inside the cavity.
 In a second regime of higher Reynolds number, the interaction leads to
 intermittent behavior leading to a bursting phenomena where the recirculating
 vortex tends to oscillate in size leading to it bursting through the shear
 layer to release vorticity.
 While doing so, the flow is said to be strongly turbulent.
 In the third regime typically at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=33500$
\end_inset

, (for our low speed cove recirculation, 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=54000$
\end_inset

), the bursting oscillations and associated pressure oscillations become
 more frequent but irregular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the later work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the rectangular cavities were further analyzed using three-dimensional
 global instability analysis to show that the spanwise instability wavelength
 scales are proportional to the cavity depth.
 An image of the spanwise modulated velocity fields from their original
 work are shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spanwisemodesbres-2"

\end_inset

.
 The resulting spanwise modulated flow also develop oscillations that can
 induce a low frequency pulsation of the recirculating vortex.
 This frequency was deduced to have one order of magnitude lower than the
 Rossiter oscillations.
 The dependence of the growth rate of the spanwise modes with Reynolds number
 was also identified along with a critical value that would trigger the
 formation of the spanwise modes.
 However, the most interesting argument made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 was that the spanwise instability was a result of the curvature of the
 flow, i.e.
 the curved streamline of the recirculating vortices in the cavity would
 lead to a centrifugal instability that is different from the Rossiter oscillati
ons and the Görtler type instability that occurs on curved boundary walls.
 This argument finds its strength from the fact that the location of the
 strongest spanwise modulation is in the region of strong curvature of the
 recirculation bubble on the downstream corner of the cavity.
 The spanwise modulated recirculation vortex would develop also a low frequency
 oscillation, and this additional oscillations can interfere with the Rossiter
 modes to modulate both its frequency and peak amplitudes.

That being noted on the spanwise mode formations, the same argument, along
 with the fact that for both the shear layer on a backward facing step and
 the recirculation streamline in open cavity flows have, in common, a curved
 streamline with one side bounded by a shear layer, we choose to investigate
 the case of slat cove dynamics in terms of its peculiarities arising from
 curved streamline path of its shear layer.
 In line with this hypothesis, the behavior of a curved shear layer was
 also studied by

.
 His work studied the linear inviscid hydrodynamic stability of a slightly
 curved free shear layer.
 The study compared the cases of a stably curved and unstably curved shear
 layer identifying sensitivity of the flow to the addition of curvature
 to an already present shear layer.
 The formation of Görtler vortices was identified as a possible reason for
 the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs while
 the unstably curved regime is present.
 The work also provides a non-dimensional parameter, the curvature Richardson
 number, to quantify the effect of an accelerated generation of streamwise
 vortices and will be used for comparison in our study as well.

From the above-mentioned array of ideas, we tend to theorize that the slat
 cove dynamics at the current Reynolds number has the following features
 and explanations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slat shear layer formed due to the difference of velocity between the
 free-stream and the recirculation vortex leads to the canonical Kelvin-Helmholt
z (K-H) instability as well identified in the literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Terracol2016,Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The saturation of K-H instability leads to the generation of 2-dimensional
 spanwise coherent structures being shed periodically from the cusp.
 If these vortices were to be convected in a straight line path, their behavior
 would only have the peculiarities of a vortex convected through an accelerated
 flow.
 However, since the established mean flow is such that the streamlines are
 curved along with the shear layer to facilitate flow through the slat gap,
 the vortices also follow a curved trajectory.
 This curvature of the streamline necessarily have a mean diameter of curvature
 similar in magnitude to the slat chord length.
 The spanwise coherent vortices which undergo such strong curvature experience
 an additional centrifugal force.
 Here, the pressure distribution inside the slat cove is lower than the
 pressure outside the cove region due to the fact that the region outside
 the slat cove is at the pressure side of the main element and is affected
 by presence of stagnation point on the main-element.
 Hence, the normal pressure gradient along the shear layer is positive along
 a radius of curvature of the shear layer with center of rotation inside
 the cove.
 This radial pressure gradient opposes the centrifugal force thereby requiring
 a balancing of these forces to enable a stable flow.
 This is the classical requirement for a dynamic instability to occur where
 two opposing forces which are supposed to be balanced are, in reality,
 not exactly and dynamically balanced, thereby leading to large growth rate
 for certain class of perturbations.
 The curved shear layer is hence susceptible to the curvature instability
 leading to the typical steady spanwise modes primarily attached to the
 shear layer as described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Velocity-Magnitude-Mean-Cove-1"

\end_inset

, it can be noticed that for the early part of the shear layer, the lower
 velocity flow is on the concave side of the shear layer curvature.
 This is a stable curvature since according to Rayleigh criteria the equilibrium
 is stable against curvature instability if the angular momentum decreases
 radially outward
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rayleigh1917"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In early shear layer, the streamline velocity is increasing radially outward
 from the cove center and hence the curvature instability is stabilized.
 Furthermore, as inferred by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the initial K-H instability may also be stabilized partially leading to
 a reduced growth rate of the streamwise perturbations suggesting a delayed
 spanwise vortex generation due to the effect of curvature.
 Hence, in this regime, the major noticeable dynamics are a delayed generation
 of K-H vortices as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 together with the large spanwise modulations arising from the convective
 instability of the recirculation from the suggestion of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the flow progresses downstream, the shear layer weakens due to its spreading
 and growth of spanwise vortices.
 Simultaneously, the radius of curvature also decreases to eventually reverse
 its sign.
 Once the sign of curvature reverses and re-strengthen near the vicinity
 of the slat trailing edge region, i.e., the streamlines curve such that the
 low pressure area of the suction peak on the main element is again on the
 concave side of the streamlines near the slat gap, and the high pressure
 region generated due to the impingement of the shear layer on the slat
 trailing edge is on its convex side.
 This reversed configuration of pressure gradient is again opposing the
 centrifugal acceleration facilitating curvature instability again.
 However, unlike the early shear layer, the velocity field can be noticed
 to have the high velocity stream on the concave side of the curvature.
 This according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is the unstably curved configuration and satisfy the Rayleigh criterion
 to have a radially decreasing angular momentum.
 Hence the shear layer now develops a strong centrifugal instability leading
 to the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs.
 This generation of small scale structures are strongly accelerated by the
 presence of the ingested vortices from the recirculation region.
 It must be clearly noted that the regime of flow near the slat trailing
 edge is the asymptotic case for the linear stability analyzed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 whose conclusions are only directly valid for a curved free shear layer
 with small curvatures.
 The effective range of curvature Richardson numbers for their analysis
 is of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 where for the slat shear layer, these are on average two orders of magnitude
 higher as we will show in the upcoming session.
 Hence, for the later part of the shear layer near the impingement location
 and flow through the slat gap, the major phenomena is the curvature instability
 driven by a considerably lower radius of curvature with a mean velocity
 distribution enabling a fully unstable configuration.
 The only noticeable effect is hence the generation of streamwise oriented
 counter rotating vortex pairs which assimilate into larger streamwise vortices
 on the slat trailing edge and are elongated and ejected through the slat
 gap.
 The terminology used in the recent literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wang2019,Wang2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that these are `Görtler like' transition is hence logically valid, although
 there is no curved boundary layer as in the case of the canonical Görtler
 transition that leads to small scale streamwise oriented structures.
 Note that since this is a purely centrifugal instability, meaning that
 this generation of streamwise structures would happen even if there was
 no supply of spanwise coherent vortices in the impinging shear layer, as
 reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wang2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Their work demonstrates that at low enough Reynolds numbers, the periodic
 vortex shedding from the slat cusp is suppressed, possibly due to the combined
 effect of the stabilization of K-H instability due to curvature and the
 low Reynolds number, and the only noticeable turbulence generation is that
 of the streamwise vortices near the trailing edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, inside the recirculation, the flow developing spanwise modulation
 was previously unidentified in the literature although it was noticed early
 that the vorticity ejected from the slat gap had spanwise modulations.
 The flow in the cove region was largely analyzed under the assumption that
 it is spanwise homogeneous, and at this point of understanding the cove
 dynamics, it is striking why the prediction of cove flow and related acoustics
 remained elusive from a perfectly predictive modelling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Souza2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This we suggest is due to the fact that the three dimensionality of the
 flow due to the spanwise modulation would induce additional oscillations,
 suggestively with frequency one order of magnitude lower than the first
 Rossiter tone, which can modulate the tonal frequencies and the amplitude
 of the peaks as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This tone, or more precisely a broadband hump in the low frequency was
 clearly identified in the work of

, who characterized the same as having a different source mechanism compared

 turbulent region like that of the slat cove and flow around the airfoil
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, together with the fact that the intermittent bursting phenomena associated
 with oscillation of the recirculation vortex can both significantly broaden
 the frequency bandwidth of fluctuations effected by this mechanism on a
 far-field microphone.
 This broadband hump is also in the low frequency range which is dominated
 by the measurement noise from the experimental setup and noise from the
 shear layer of the open jet wind tunnel adding to their elusiveness.
 Thus when tonal character of slat noise was rightly identified as those
 related to the Rossiter mechanism by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 spanwise homogeneity and thereby wrongly advising the choice of methodology
 for both experimentation and numerical studies so far.

The placement of FWH surfaces requires careful consideration for reasons
 detailed in the previous chapter.
 The primary challenge is the positioning the surface to allow vortical
 structures to exit the computational region without crossing it.
 However, utilizing an open surface inherently reduces predicted pressure
 levels, as acoustic wave fronts from internal sources interact with the
 entire surface area, albeit with varying timing and amplitudes.
 This challenge is mitigated by spherical spreading, where wave amplitudes
 decay with increasing distance from the source.
 Consequently, surface regions far from the source contribute less significantly
 to the far-field observer measurements.
 This physical behavior allows positioning of the open part of the surface
 sufficiently downstream from the main element while maintaining acceptable
 accuracy

To optimize surface placement and evaluate far-field sound contributions,
 we conducted multiple test cases.
 Our investigation began with an oval surface positioned close to the airfoil,
 which was progressively modified into a C-shape and enlarged to contain
 the ejected cove vorticity within the airfoil's suction side, thereby preventin
g spurious effects.
 While results from the oval surface testing are presented in Appendix A1,
 we focus here on the optimal C-shaped surface configuration here.

 Their primary utility is in the open ended shape which allows the convected
 vortices to exit through the open side and since the open side can be kept
 sufficiently far, the radiation of the downstream eddies is expected to
 have a negligible effect onto the sound field regions that are upstream
 of the surface open end.
 In our case they also allow to avoid large size low vorticity structures
 on the suction side by careful placement.
 They also provide sufficient space to be confidently deployed to parametric
 case simulations such that when the slat positioning is varied, the increase
 or decrease of ejected flow will not necessarily cross the upper part of
 the surface, thereby enabling easier parameterisation.

 All microphones show a steady mean-pressure that corresponds to the local
 flow pressure as the microphones places in the non-turbulent region.
 The mean pressure is however not same across the probes and a constant
 pressure at the ambient is subtracted from the total pressure for the FWH
 calculation.
 The residual value of pressure reflects as the non-zero mean value of the
 microphone recording, but does not affect the calculations of farfield
 sound since only the time derivative of pressure is used in the FWH formulation
 and not the absolute values.
 Accordingly, to avoid the DC component in the spectra computed using Welsh's
 method, a constant local mean subtraction is also enabled for each of the
 averaging windows.
\end_layout

 where they are compared with the spectra from the VALIANT experiment (WT
 experiment).
 The comparison of results show a good performance of the numerical framework
 in capturing the far-field tones and the broadband characteristic slat
 noise.
 For an observer at 
\begin_inset Formula $-90^{o}$
\end_inset

 at the pressure side of the airfoil, the prediction obtains the peak at
 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

, and the higher harmonics of the fundamental which is at 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the first Rossiter tone for this case according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 For the fundamental tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

, the experimental spectrum also misses the first tone primarily due to
 the fact that at frequencies of 
\begin_inset Formula $800\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 and below, the installation noise dominates the acoustic field in the experimen
tal setup.
 In addition, the fundamental tone has a lower SPL component that hardly
 peaks out of the main spectrum as a small hump.
 This suggests that the source radiation might be strongly distorted by
 the local large eddies resulting in a flattening and broadening of the
 associated peak
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Nevertheless, the hump is visible at the upstream microphone on the pressure

 as seen in Fig.

 Furthermore, we demonstrate in a subsequent chapter using a slightly adjusted
 position of the slat that this first peak can in fact be captured with
 stronger power levels in the same simulation setup and installation effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the first main tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

, which is the second Rossiter tone, the simulation faithfully reproduces
 the experimental frequency.
 However, the measured sound level is considerably higher at this frequency,
 which is not captured by the free stream simulation.
 A separate simulation including the installation geometries was also performed
 (see Appendix A.3), which showed better agreement at 1771 Hz.
 This suggests that the amplification of this tone can be due to the effect
 of the lateral side plates.
 Indeed, a spanwise resonance can be reasonably suspected to be present
 in the experiment.
 The experiment was designed with a span-to-chord ratio of 1, leading to
 separation between the plates to be 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

.
 The fundamental tone for resonance between the plates is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{S0}=572\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 whose second harmonic is at 
\begin_inset Formula $1716\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

.
 This is close to the 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the first harmonic of the cavity resonance.
 Furthermore, while comparing with the simulation that included the spanwise
 lateral plates, both wall pressure recording and the farfield spectra show
 that the first tone obtained in the installed case is amplified with respect
 to the free stream configuration and hence reaches better agreement with
 the experiment.
 This supports the assumption that the disparity of the first tone is not
 an inaccuracy due to the simulation methodology but has a physical background.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Interestingly, in the further chapters of this thesis, this disparity is
 also explained further as due to the stronger development of the centrifugal
 effect of the cove recirculation in the case of a cleaner spanwise flow
 in the free-stream simulation.

For higher frequencies, the spectra downstream of the airfoil on pressure
 side, i.e.
 Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 (see Fig
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fwhobservers-1-1"

\end_inset

), shows good agreement.
 The obtained agreement between the simulation in free flow condition and
 wind tunnel experiment is hence reasonable.
 In contrast, microphones facing the suction side (which are not shown)
 registered higher levels for the frequencies above 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,\text{kHz}$$ $

\end_inset

 and are possibly due to sources on the suction side of the HLD.
 Both turbulence ejection from the slat and its impingement on to the suction
 side of the airfoil leads to generation of high frequency noise.
 Since this is not of particular interest for the cove related noise, it
 is not investigated in our work.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, in the experiment, it is possible that the high frequency noise
 is attenuated by the presence of the jet shear layer and hence lower sound
 levels for the higher frequencies at farfield observer.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, as mentioned, the spanwise extent of airfoil is not the same
 in both experiment and simulation.
 For the experiment, the distance between lateral side plates is kept as
 1 chord length, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $C=0.3\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand the simulation uses a chord length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.66C=0.2\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

.
 Theoretically, the experiment is designed to isolate a region between the
 plates which is unaffected by the boundary layer and the corner flow formed
 at the junction of side plates and the airfoil.
 But an exact estimation of what length along the span is effectively free
 from this disturbance and hence acoustically effective is not possible
 from the available data.
 Hence a correction of the sound level corresponding to the spanwise length
 difference can not be considered.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

Nevertheless, since the exact spanwise length that is acoustically active
 in the experiment is ambiguous, such a calculation is not trivial.

 geometry case, we used the Q-criterion visualization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to first isolate the vortices.
 The Q-criterion is defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Q & =\frac{1}{2}\left((\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})^{2}+|\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\Omega}}|_{2}^{2}-|\mathbf{S}|_{2}^{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is the instantaneous velocity vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

 is the strain rate tensor or symmetric part of the velocity gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$
\end_inset

 is the vorticity tensor or the anti-symmetric part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $|.|_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the Frobenius norm.
 The Q-criterion serves as a scalar which represents relative magnitude
 of the vorticity component as opposed to the strain rate.
 In the volume occupied by a vortex, the vortex core has a strong vorticity
 component with minimal strain (hence a larger Q-value) and vice-versa on
 the exterior.
 Hence, by choosing a suitable Q-criteria and obtaining the isocontours
 of the same, vortex structures can be identified given the 3D unsteady
 velocity field.
 To use the same, we use the internal calculator of the ProLB solver to
 record the Q-values along with the unsteady velocity field and extract
 the isocontours using the visualization software ParaView.

The selection of Q-criterion depends on the application and a good visualization
 is obtained by iterative refinement.
 For our application, the Q-value of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.4\times10^{8}$
\end_inset

 was found to isolate the vortices in the flow as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:IsoQcrit"

\end_inset

.
 As an additional aid in visualization, we also use one additional Q-value
 which is 
\begin_inset Formula $70%\ensuremath{\%}
$
\end_inset

 higher.
 This allow to visualize the exterior of the spanwise rollers in addition
 to their inner vortex core.
 The coloring of the isosurface aid in identification of dynamics associated
 with the vortex.
 Here we color the same using the vorticity value which aids in identifying
 the core from the exterior surface.
 The spanwise vorticity behavior can then be isolated by setting the transparenc
y settings in order to selectively highlight the structure based on the
 vorticity component on the iso-contours.
 By using the spanwise vorticity as the coloring criteria and for transparency,
 the spanwise rollers shed from the slat cusp can be clearly identified
 as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SpanwiseRollers"
plural "false"

\end_inset

.
 As expected, the spanrollers can be noted to have a strong spanwise coherent
 vorticity in the the vicinity of the slat cusp with progressive dispersion
 until the mid shear layer where the sense of curvature of the shear layer
 reverses.
 By sense of curvature we refer to the fact that the low speed recirculation
 region is on the concave side of the mean shear layer.
 Once the sign of curvature changes, i.e.
 the low speed flow is on the convex side of the curvature, the spanwise
 vortices can be noticed to disintegrate strongly by generation of smaller
 streamwise vortices primarily formed from the periphery of the spanwise
 structures, leading to the ejection of majorly streamwise vortices through
 the slat gap as shown in Fig.

 A close up visualization of the vortex structures ejected from the slat
 trailing edge are shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 It must be mentioned that in addition to the streamwise vortices, this
 case also has comparatively similar, although less amount of residual spanwise
 vorticity that passes through the slat gap.
 This residual spanwise vorticity is a necessary component for the generation
 of the aeroacoustic phenomena since the streamwise vortices are far less
 efficient than spanwise coherent vortices to generate acoustic waves due
 to trailing edge scattering

, made available as the supplementary document to this thesis, reveal that
 the process of generation of the streamwise vortices in the current case
 is particularly near and after the region where the curvature of the mean
 shear layer switches signs.
 This fact however does not allow us to clearly state that the transition
 of vorticity is definitively due to the effect of curvature.
 This is due to the fact that the region near the slat gap is a region of
 both streamwise acceleration and deceleration of the mean flow.
 The acceleration is due to the nozzle like shape of the region leading
 to the slat gap while the deceleration is caused by the stagnation region
 due to the impingement.
 The area of impingement region generates a zone of stagnation for the mean
 flow which further reduces the area available for the flow to exit, aggravating
 the nozzle effect of the geometry further.
 This complex interaction of the dynamic forces of the fluid hence makes
 it difficult to state that the vorticity transition is definitively driven
 by the curvature effect alone.
 Nevertheless, it is clear that the major source of the streamwise vortices
 is by the transition from the spanwise coherent structures along the later
 stages of the curved shear layer.
 Additionally, the curved wall of the inner slat is susceptible to the well-know

, and are potentially contributing to the generation of streamwise structures
 in the recirculation particularly close to the slat cusp whose inner wall
 has a strong curvature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another notable feature of the unsteady flow is the uneven distribution
 of the recirculation vortices inside the cove region as seen in both Fig.

.
 The streamwise vortices which are more populous tend to be sparse in the
 region close to the mid trajectory of shear layer and at the center of
 recirculation whereas the density is higher along the curved inner wall
 of the slat.
 The streamwise vortices that reach the impingement location are inevitability
 stretched along the wall due to the streamwise accelerated ejection and
 the stretched vortices disintegrate into smaller vortices as they enter
 the recirculation.
 These smaller vortices then move along the wall and experience the centrifugal
 force due to the curved streamline of the recirculation.
 The centrifugal force hence explains the tendency of the vortices to stay
 in the outer periphery of the cove recirculation causing sparsity near
 the centre of recirculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recirculating streamwise structures also reach the slat cusp by moving
 along the inner slat wall.
 These structures can be noted to interfere with the shear layer in the
 region near the slat cusp and also in the early shear layer.
 The structures then interfere with the spanwise vortices accelerating the
 generation of more streamwise vortices in the process.
 This also aggravates the fact that the streamwise vortices are sparser
 in the mid-region of the slat shear layer since a major portion of the
 recirculated streamwise vortices are entrained into the shear layer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vortex stretching happening at the trailing edge is also worthy of further
 mention.
 The impinging vortices in the shear layer is a mix of streamwise and spanwise
 vortices with streamwise vortices in larger proportion.
 The latter majorly wind around and form ladder structures together with
 the spanwise structures.
 Near the wall at impingement, the streamwise vortices become stronger and
 assimilate to larger structures, and, as they impinge, the streamwise structure
s are elongated in both the forward and backward directions, towards the
 ejected and recirculated directions respectively.
 Here the stretching is stronger in the downstream direction through the
 slat gap.
 The streamwise vortices in the slat wall are also continuously replenished
 by incoming vortices and as they interact with the wall as they tend to
 roll along wall in the spanwise direction.
 This leads to counter rotating vortices coalescing to form large counter-rotati
ng vortex pairs.
 These counter rotating vortex pairs can be visualized by using a diverging
 colourmap that highlights the streamwise vorticity in opposing directions
 as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The ejected counter rotating vortices and residual smaller streamwise vortices
 are then flushed on to the suction side of the main element.
 The counter rotating pairs often undergo further instability to form helical
 structures before impinging with the suction side wall on main element
 and can noticed in Fig.

\begin_layout Standard
The mean streamlines ejected from the trailing edge location need not necessaril
y directly graze the main element.
 However, in the unsteady dynamics, the ejected vortices tend to have an
 unsteady oscillation which redirects the ejected vortices to have a flapping
 motion towards and away from the main element suction wall.
 This low frequency oscillation also leads to oscillation of the reattachment
 point of the ejected streamwise vortices on the main element.

 Accompanied by their impingement on the wall near TE, the oscillating pressure
 field also exerts its influence over to the leading edge of the main element.
 Hence the hydrodynamic pressure in the slat gap has periodic fluctuations
 synchronized with the pressure fluctuations due to the convected vortices.
 From the 2D visualization at mid-span, the pressure inside the cove region
 also appears to have an oscillating component of considerably lower frequency
 than other stronger fluctuations of smaller length scales.
 From such a distribution of the periodic pressure fluctuation, it is hence
 expected that the shear layer modes would be particularly dominant in a
 model order reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
 (POD) or Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD).
 However, since these fluctuations are purely hydrodynamic, an inference
 of the acoustic interactions in the slat cove would still be difficult
 unless the hydrodynamic and acoustics modes are explicitly segregated.

The unsteady velocity field can shed further light on the three-dimensionality
 of the flow which is not evident from the pressure fields.
 But before elaborating on this, we first plot the unsteady velocity components
 on a colormap suited to highlight the macro flow features outside recirculation
 zone.
 As seen in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the velocity magnitude highlights the flow topology as the fluid accelerates
 through the slat gap.
 The ambient/inlet velocity of the simulation is at 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{0}=50\thinspace\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

, which is accelerated upto a maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $105\,\text{m/s}$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, it can be noticed that the major unsteadiness is confined to a region
 close to the slat TE while the larger area of the slat gap maintains a
 steady flow.
 This suggests that the ejected vortices, which are understood to be majorly
 streamwise structures, tend to primarily graze the surface of the slat
 trailing edge and the leading edge wall of the main element experience
 a smoother flow.
 The unsteady velocity components also tend to suggest uneven distribution
 inside the slat cove and are generally consistent with the effects of flow
 redirection through slat gap from the pressure side.
 This can be noticed in the broader distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{X}$

 inside the cove region and the same for 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{Y}$

Time-averaged flow fields

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Given that the unsteady dynamics has an array of interesting features worthy
 of further exploration, it is important to understand the time-averaged
 fields in tandem.
 The mean flow field convects the fluid and its vortices to establish the
 macro-flow features like the accelerated flow through the slat gap and
 the recirculation region.
 Within this configuration, the unsteadiness can be thought to be introduced
 by generation of vorticity due to the presence of slat cusp or the shear
 layer.
 These vortices then develop unsteady dynamics which leads to the aeroacoustics.
 Hence the vortex dynamics itself is intrinsically first determined by the
 established mean flow.

 The mean pressure, as can be noted, drops significantly near and downstream
 of the slat gap leading to a negative spike.
 This suction peak enhances the lift performance of the wing.
 Looking more closely on to the slat cove, the visualization is made in

 The region of impingement is distinctly identifiable as a region of high
 pressure due to the partial stagnation of the flow and hence the reduction
 in the flow area through the slat gap.
 It is also evident that the low pressure core of the cove due to recirculation
 is not exactly at the center of recirculation itself but shifted nearer
 to the shear layer.

 The spanwise velocity is then visualized on this plane with suitable colourmap

The spanwise modulations and their obscurity in slat noise literature lead
 us to many interesting thoughts of which the following three are worthy
 of mention here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First is that the alternating time-averaged spanwise velocity means that
 there exist static nodal planes towards which the flow can converge and
 diverge from.
 Those planes whose both sides have spanwise velocity such that it decreases
 from positive to negative along the spanwise direction and hence have the
 flow directed towards the plane will be referred to as the `converging
 plane'.
 The other type of planes where the spanwise velocity increases from negative
 to positive necessitating the flow to diverge from the plane are the `diverging
 planes'.
 Since these planes act as sources and sinks for the spanwise dynamics,
 they must facilitate the interaction of the spanwise dynamics with the
 2-dimensional dynamics in the streamwise direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Second is that if such nodal planes exist, it is necessary that there must
 exist a mechanism to redistribute the fluid from the converging planes
 and to replenish the diverging planes continuously to establish a steady
 dynamics.
 Here, we have already seen that the recirculating small scale streamwise
 vortices are absorbed into the shear layer in regions near the mid trajectory.
 This suggests that for a converging plane, the mechanism to redistribute
 the fluid is by entertainment of flow along with the streamwise structures
 into the shear layer, which must also lead to higher concentration(spanwise)
 of streamwise structures at the locations of the converging planes.
 There must also be a lower concentration of the streamwise structures in
 the diverging planes.
 Nevertheless, this may not be a phenomena easily observed in a largely
 turbulent state at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=10^{6}$
\end_inset

 with constant generation, distortion, and redistribution of vorticity,
 as in the slat cove.

The driving factor for the spanwise modulations should be the result of
 a dynamic instability either due to the shear layer geometry or due to
 the recirculating flow.
 Similar spanwise modulations are documented for flow over a backward facing
 step by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Their work categorically demonstrated the existence of large scale spanwise
 modulations in the shear layer due to the presence of a backward facing
 step, and argues that the spanwise modulations are the result of an absolute
 convective instability owing to the closed loop streamline in the recirculation
 bubble leading to generation of steady spanwise modes.
 The eigen functions identified in their work using the linear stability
 analysis of a simplified flow configuration, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:barkleyspanmodes"

\end_inset

, predicts the spanwise wavelength with same order as that of the cavity
 depth.
 This is consistent with the observation that the spanwise cells in the
 slat cove have a wavelength with same order as the slat chord.
 On comparing the rectangular flow cavity with the slat cove, the cavity
 depth is analogous to the diameter of the recirculating cove flow, and
 this diameter is approximately the slat chord.
 Their study also suggest a critical Reynolds number, although at a low
 range of 
\begin_inset Formula $Re_{c}=748$
\end_inset

, from which the spanwise modulations are dominant and this critical Reynolds
 number is also argued to be decreased when a lateral side wall is present.
 In the case of simulations with spanwise periodic conditions mimicking
 an infinite spanwise domain, the critical Reynolds number is also increased.
 The case of slat cove dynamics is at a Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 based on the mean flow and if considering the flow inside the cove region,
 taking the mean velocity to be 
\begin_inset Formula $20\,\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

, and the characteristic length scale to be the slat chord, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}=0.039\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

, corresponding Reynolds number is at 
\begin_inset Formula $54000$
\end_inset

.
 This regime is still two orders of magnitude higher than that required
 to trigger the convective instability.
 The presence of spanwise walls are also of much importance for the slat
 cove flow as well, since, in our simulations we employ periodic conditions,
 and in experimental studies the lateral side walls are necessary to support
 the HLD mockup in the wind tunnel.
 Hence, drawing parallels between the fact that the flow over a backward
 facing step is much similar to the shear layer geometry of the slat cusp,
 particularly due to the fact that the slat cove also has one side bounded
 by a shear layer and both have a recirculation bubble in which the spanwise
 modes tend to dominate, we suspect the same mechanism is also in action
 in the slat cove dynamics.

 For the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Neary1987"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, three regimes of flow for an open rectangular cavity based on the Reynold's
 number was identified.
 In the first, there is a strong interaction of the shear layer with the
 recirculating vortex inside the cavity.
 In a second regime of higher Reynolds number, the interaction leads to
 intermittent behavior leading to a bursting phenomena where the recirculating
 vortex tends to oscillate in size leading to it bursting through the shear
 layer to release vorticity.
 While doing so, the flow is said to be strongly turbulent.
 In the third regime typically at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=33500$
\end_inset

, (for our low speed cove recirculation, 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=54000$
\end_inset

), the bursting oscillations and associated pressure oscillations become
 more frequent but irregular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the later work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the rectangular cavities were further analyzed using three-dimensional
 global instability analysis to show that the spanwise instability wavelength
 scales are proportional to the cavity depth.
 The resulting spanwise modulated flow also develop oscillations that can
 induce a low frequency pulsation of the recirculating vortex.
 This frequency was deduced to have one order of magnitude lower than the
 Rossiter oscillations.
 The dependence of the growth rate of the spanwise modes with Reynolds number
 was also identified along with a critical value that would trigger the
 formation of the spanwise modes.
 However, the most interesting argument made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 was that the spanwise instability was a result of the curvature of the
 flow, i.e.
 the curved streamline of the recirculating vortices in the cavity would
 lead to a centrifugal instability that is different from the Rossiter oscillati
ons and the Görtler type instability that occurs on curved boundary walls.
 This argument finds its strength from the fact that the location of strongest
 spanwise modulation is in the region of strong curvature of the recirculation
 bubble on the downstream corner of the cavity.
 The spanwise modulated recirculation vortex would develop also a low frequency
 oscillation, and this additional oscillations can interfere with the Rossiter
 modes to modulate both its frequency and peak amplitudes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
That being noted on the spanwise mode formations, the same argument, along
 with the fact that for both the shear layer on a backward facing step and
 the recirculation streamline in open cavity flows have, in common, a curved
 streamline with one side bounded by a shear layer, we choose to investigate
 the case of slat cove dynamics in terms its peculiarities arising from
 curved streamline path of its shear layer.
 In line with this hypothesis, the behavior of a curved shear layer was
 also studied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"

\end_inset

.
 His work studied the linear inviscid hydrodynamic stability of a slightly
 curved free shear layer.
 The study compared the cases of a stably curved and unstably curved shear
 layer identifying sensitivity of the flow to the addition of curvature
 to an already present shear layer.
 The formation of Görtler vortices was identified as a possible reason for
 the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs while
 the unstably curved regime is present.
 The work also provides a non-dimensional parameter, the curvature Richardson
 number, to quantify the effect an accelerated generation of streamwise
 vortices and will be used for comparison in our study as well.

From the above-mentioned array of ideas, we tend to theorize that the slat
 cove dynamics at the current Reynolds number has the following features
 and explanations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The slat shear layer formed due to the difference of velocity between the
 free-stream and the recirculation vortex leads to the canonical Kelvin-Helmholt
z (K-H) instability as well identified in the literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Terracol2016,Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The saturation of K-H instability leads to the generation of 2-dimensional
 spanwise coherent structures being shed periodically from the cusp.
 If these vortices were to be convected in a straight line path, their behavior
 would only have the peculiarities of a vortex convected through an accelerated
 flow.
 However, since the established mean flow is such that the streamlines are
 curved along with the shear layer to facilitate flow through the slat gap,
 the vortices also follow a curved trajectory.
 This curvature of the streamline necessarily have a mean diameter of curvature
 similar in magnitude to the slat chord length.
 The spanwise coherent vortices which undergo such strong curvature experience
 an additional centrifugal force.
 Here, the pressure distribution inside the slat cove is lower than the
 pressure outside the cove region due to the fact that the region outside
 the slat cove is at the pressure side of the main element and is affected
 by presence of stagnation point on the main-element.
 Hence, the normal pressure gradient along the shear layer is positive along
 a radius of curvature of the shear layer with center of rotation inside
 the cove.
 This radial pressure gradient opposes the centrifugal force thereby requiring
 a balancing of these forces to enable a stable flow.
 This is the classical requirement for a dynamic instability to occur where
 two opposing forces which are supposed to be balanced are, in reality,
 not exactly and dynamically balanced, thereby leading to large growth rate
 for certain class of perturbations.
 The curved shear layer is hence susceptible to the curvature instability
 leading to the typical steady spanwise modes primarily attached to the
 shear layer as described by

, it can be noticed that for the early part of the shear layer, the lower
 velocity flow is on the concave side of the shear layer curvature.
 This is a stable curvature since according to Rayleigh criteria the equilibrium
 is stable against curvature instability if the angular momentum decreases
 radially outward
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rayleigh1917"

.
 In early shear layer, the streamline velocity is increasing radially outward
 from the cove center and hence the curvature instability is stabilized.
 Furthermore, as inferred by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the initial K-H instability may also be stabilized partially leading to
 a reduced growth rate of the streamwise perturbations suggesting a delayed
 spanwise vortex generation due to the effect of curvature.
 Hence, in this regime, the major noticeable dynamics are a delayed generation
 of K-H vortices as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As the flow progresses downstream, the shear layer weakens due to its spreading
 and growth of spanwise vortices.
 Simultaneously, the radius of curvature also decreases to eventually reverse
 its sign.
 Once the sign of curvature reverses and strengthen near the vicinity of
 the slat trailing edge region, i.e., the streamlines curve such that the
 low pressure area of the suction peak on the main element is again on the
 concave side of the streamlines near the slat gap, and the high pressure
 region generated due to the impingement of the shear layer on the slat
 trailing edge is on its convex side.
 This reversed configuration of pressure gradient is again opposing the
 centrifugal acceleration facilitating curvature instability again.
 However, unlike the early shear layer, the velocity field can be noticed
 to have the high velocity stream on the concave side of the curvature.
 This according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is the unstably curved configuration and satisfy the Rayleigh criterion
 to have a radially decreasing angular momentum.
 Hence the shear layer now develops a strong centrifugal instability leading
 to the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs.
 This generation of small scale structures are strongly accelerated by the
 presence of the ingested vortices from the recirculation region.
 It must be clearly noted that the regime of flow near the slat trailing
 edge is the asymptotic case for the linear stability analyzed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 whose conclusions are only directly valid for a curved free shear layer
 with small curvature.
 The effective range of curvature Richardson numbers for their analysis
 is of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 where for the slat shear layer, these are on average two orders of magnitude
 higher as we show in the upcoming session.
 Hence, for the later part of the shear layer near the impingement location
 and flow through the slat gap, the major phenomena is the curvature instability
 driven by a considerably lower radius of curvature with a mean velocity
 distribution enabling a fully unstable configuration.
 The only noticeable effect is hence the generation of streamwise oriented
 counter rotating vortex pairs which assimilate into larger streamwise vortices
 on the slat trailing edge and are elongated and ejected through the slat
 gap.
 The terminology used in the recent literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wang2019,Wang2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that these are `Görtler like' transition is hence logically valid, although
 there is no curved boundary layer as in the case of the canonical Görtler
 transition that leads to small scale streamwise oriented structures.
 Note that since this is a purely centrifugal instability, meaning that
 this generation of streamwise structures would happen even if there was
 no supply of spanwise coherent vortices in the impinging shear layer, as
 reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Their work demonstrates that at low enough Reynolds numbers, the periodic
 vortex shedding from the slat cusp is suppressed, possibly due to the combined
 effect of the stabilization of K-H instability due to curvature and the
 low Reynolds number, and the only noticeable turbulence generation is that
 of the streamwise vortices near the trailing edge.

Finally, inside the recirculation, the flow developing spanwise modulation
 was previously unidentified in the literature although it was noticed early
 that the vorticity ejected from the slat gap had spanwise modulations.
 The flow in the cove region was largely analyzed under the assumption that
 it is spanwise homogeneous, and at this point of understanding the cove
 dynamics, it is striking why the prediction of cove flow and related acoustics
 remained elusive from a perfectly predictive modelling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This we suggest is due to the fact that the three dimensionality of the
 flow due to the spanwise modulation would induce additional oscillations,
 suggestively with frequency one order of magnitude lower than the first
 Rossiter tone, which can modulate the tonal frequencies and the amplitude
 of the peaks as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This tone, or more precisely a broadband hump in the low frequency was
 clearly identified in the work of

, together with the fact that the intermittent bursting phenomena associated
 with oscillation of the recirculation vortex can both significantly broaden
 the frequency bandwidth of fluctuations effected by this mechanism on a
 far-field microphone.
 This broadband hump is also in the low frequency range which is dominated
 by the measurement noise from the experimental setup and noise from the
 shear layer of the open jet wind tunnel adding to their elusiveness.
 Thus when tonal character of slat noise was rightly identified as those
 related to the Rossiter mechanism by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, their modulation mechanism was overlooked due to the assumption of the
 spanwise homogeneity and thereby the choice of methodology for both experimenta

Now, before moving on to further discussion of the unsteady data related
 to the acoustics, we take a light detour to showcase a few additional simulatio
ns to establish that the formation of spanwise modes are not purely an artifact
 of the numerical simulation.
 This is evident from the fact that the same phenomena is observed in both
 flow over a backward facing step

To demonstrate that the formation of spanwise modes is not an artifact of
 the simulation or the spanwise boundary condition applied, we discuss a
 few simulations which have a slightly varied configurations.
 For this first we take the case of simulation of VALIANT HLD geometry which
 has the wind tunnel geometry and the supporting lateral sidewalls included
 in the simulation.
 Then we discuss the simulations where the spanwise length of the domain
 is reduced by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$

, and then a case with only two rectangular plates included to use reflecting
 boundary conditions in the spanwise boundaries as opposed to periodic condition
s used in the standard simulations.
 All these cases are shown to develop the spanwise cells for the time-averaged
 spanwise velocity field.

 As can be noted, the cell formation due to the previously mentioned curvature
 instability is notable in the spanwise velocity distribution near the central
 plane away from the lateral walls.
 However, closer to the walls, the velocity field is more strongly modulated
 with stronger amplitudes than near the center planes.
 Such effects were also noted in the presence of the backward facing steps
 where lateral side walls generate strong three dimensionality for flow
 adjacent to the walls 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 However these can be thought to be a separate phenomenon since the lateral
 walls of the airfoil also generate additional dynamics due to the problem
 of corner separation for the turbulent boundary layer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cells near the center plane appear to have the same properties as those
 formed in the free flow simulation.
 The modulations are largely attached to the shear layer, and as the shear
 layer developed downstream, the cells inside the recirculation region tend
 to remain attached to the shear layer.
 A separate arrangement of cells with phase inversion is seen to then occupy
 the interior of the cove nearer to the curved inner wall of the slat.
 This new arrangement then develops stronger towards the slat gap but is
 noticeably more distorted due to the end wall effects.
 The nodal planes leading to converging and diverging planes are noticeable
 which suggests that the pulsating mechanism related to the low frequency
 broadband peak can be present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extent of the effect of lateral walls into the interior of the cavity
 in spanwise direction is significant.
 Current simulation suggests that more than 
\begin_inset Formula $80\%$
\end_inset

 of the spanwise extent is affected by the distortion and the curvature
 related flow structure is limited to only 
\begin_inset Formula $20\%$
\end_inset

 of the length.
 This means that curvature related low frequency pulse is considerably weaker
 in the experimental spectra and hence is also not notable.
 It is hence possible that the experiment also has reduced effect of the
 spanwise modulation leading to a reduced modulation of the tonal frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another factor worthy of mention is that in comparison with the VALIANT
 experiment which uses a spanwise length of 1 chord length, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

 as the distance between the spanwise plates, the setup for a different
 experiment on the 30P30N HLD geometry by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KamliyaJawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 used a spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of the chord to span ratio, VALIANT experiment kept 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{L_{s}}{C_{s}}=1$
\end_inset

, whereas in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

's work, a ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{L_{s}}{C_{s}}=1.42$
\end_inset

 was kept.
 The latter also was designed at a chord based Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=70000$
\end_inset

.
 The experiment was conducted at the wind tunnel facility at University
 of Bristol and lead to observation of the prominent low frequency hump
 in the spectra corresponding to the first Rossiter mode, and particularly
 with strong intermittency and stochastic character.
 From the influence of the lateral side wall plates that is shown to disrupt
 the spanwise mode formation due to centrifugal instability and the nature
 of its suspected low frequency oscillation, we conjecture that the strength
 of the low frequency hump in the noise spectra will be correlated with
 the availability of sufficient space between spanwise holding plates.
 This can also influence the strength of the tones and can be suspected
 to be the reason for the variation of strength for the alternating narrow
 bands peaks in their far-field observation.
 It is however the general experimenter's wisdom that keeping the spanwise
 distance as high as possible would reduce the three dimensional effect
 of the side wall boundary layer thereby recovering the spanwise homogeneous
 2D flow in the spanwise central plane.
 This is expected from the behavior of wide span cavities as well
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "HamiltonSmith2024"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 But counter-intuitively, this is only disrupting the development of the
 three dimensionality due to the centrifugal instability for the slate cove
 case.
 Further more, the measurement of the turbulent intensity and wall pressure
 spectrum will also be misinformed in the case of similar experiments with
 insufficient spanwise margin since the existence of a nodal plane at the
 spanwise central plane can lead to erroneous observation of either excessive
 or reduced turbulence intensity due to the converging or diverging motion
 of spanwise structures in the cove recirculation region.
 The spanwise modes and their possible oscillations hence provide a reasonable
 explanation for the intrigue upon the quasi-periodic behavior of the Rossiter
 tones in the study by

The mean flow around the airfoil in this case shows a strong deviation from
 the standard case results.
 Here the flow separates early from the leading edge of the main element
 and is hence stalled.
 The shape of the cove flow is also strongly distorted such that shear layer
 is elongated with a reduced initial curvature near the slat cusp.
 Hence this case is not successful simulation of the aerodynamics in view
 of its fidelity against the experiment, but however is still valid to be
 inspected for the effect of the spanwise condition inside the slat cove.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the spanwise cut plane across the span still retains the spanwise periodic
 cell formation.
 Here the region inside of the cove region can be seen to have the spanwise
 cells while the region outside of the shear layer region is strongly affected
 by the presence of the wall.
 The spanwise velocity near the spanwise walls are strongly perturbed by
 the boundary layer to have a mean distribution as to direct the flow towards
 the span center.

The outcome of this simulation is two fold: one is that the presence of
 spanwise cells are demonstrated to be independent of the spanwise boundary
 conditions in the simulation for the slat cove region; the second is that
 this cell formations are possible even if there is a strong incoming turbulence
 intensity.
 For the incoming turbulence, it can modify the flow such that airfoil stalls
 at an early angle of attack and also alter the shear layer shape.
 Nevertheless, the recirculation flow generates the centrifugal instability
 inside the cove and hence the spanwise cells are still present.

, the velocity distribution shows little difference in the larger two dimensiona

, the spanwise cells are formed in the early part of the shear layer as
 expected from the full span simulation.
 However, for the region corresponding to the later part of the shear layer,
 the spanwise modulation seams to have weakened leading to more homogeneity
 in the flow and reduced spanwise velocity component.
 This induced homogeneity of the flow due to spanwise condition is recognized
 in literature and have served as a criterion to determine the lower bound
 for the spanwise length of simulation domain for numerical studies

 have already studied the VALIANT geometry using different spanwise extent
 to demonstrate the same phenomena.
 For the current case, spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

 is hence inferred as insufficient to reproduce the full three dimensionality
 of the flow.
 This leads to the partial formation of the spanwise modulations in the
 early part of the shear layer due to strong curvature of the flow and a
 largely homogeneous spanwise distribution in the rest of the cove region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partial presence of the spanwise cells in a reduced span simulation
 also hints at the fact that the spanwise boundary condition acts only so
 as to induce homogeneity.
 The persistent formation of cell structures in the region of early shear
 layer with strong curvature again suggests that the 3-dimensionality is
 predominantly a centrifugal effect.
 This centrifugal flow is primarily driven by the concave curvature of the
 inner wall of the slat cusp together with the redirection of the flow by
 the incoming ambient flow from upstream.
 The persistence of the spanwise modulation at this region, while induced
 homogeneity dominating in the downstream locations, suggests that the amplifica
tion of the spanwise mode instability is higher in the region of early shear
 layer compared to other regions in the cove.

 Note that for the full span case, it maintained

 Nevertheless, the final selection of wave number is constrained by the
 fact that the spanwise boundaries have a periodic conditions thereby necessitat

 Counting this in, the given cases validates the suggestion of

\end_inset

 that the spanwise wavelength is proportional to the cavity depth and also
 that the mode formation is primarily driven by the centrifugal instability
 mechanism similar to cavity flows.
 Since this phenomenon was only discovered during the exercise of this thesis,
 we did not conduct a parametric study to understand the variation of the
 span length, along with spanwise domain length.
 Such an investigation and also a model for the prediction of cell formation
 in the particular case of slat cove flow by using linear stability analysis
 can be an interesting avenue for further investigation.

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of the mean flow inside the cove region and drawing parallels
 from the literature, particularly from that on the spanwise modulation
 of curved flows in cases of flow past a backward facing step, open cavity
 flows, and lid-driven cavity flows, it suggests to investigate the effect
 of i) the three dimensionality and ii) streamline curvature in the shear
 layer and recirculation region.
 The curvature of the streamline in the shear layer may also trigger a `Görtler'
 like transition leading to the generation of counter-rotating small-scale
 streamwise structures.
 Both these effects are fundamental to the slat noise generation mechanism
 whose tonal characteristics are necessarily influenced by the coherence
 of the impinging spanwise coherent vortices.
 Hence, to understand the curvature effects more thoroughly and to quantitativel
y understand its implications on the shear layer development, we attempt
 to characterize the mean streamlines by utilizing the mean field recording
 available from the LBM simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean streamlines can be obtained from the time-averaged velocity field.
 For our purpose, we use a constant time stepping and the mean 2-dimensional
 velocity as the gradient field as inputs to a Runge-Kutta integrator.
 Here, since we assume that the flow features in the spanwise direction
 are primarily driven by the streamline curvature in the mid-span 2D plane,
 the streamwise and cross-flow component of the velocity field is used to
 study the streamline in their 2D plane and omit the contribution of spanwise
 velocity component.
 For the Runge-Kutta integrator, we use the classical fourth order RK4 formulati
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean flow data is obtained on the Cartesian grid of the simulation.
 However, this grid is not suitable to obtain a continuous streamline and
 hence the velocity field need to be interpolated in order to obtain the
 velocity value at a given query point for the RK integrator.
 For this interpolation we use the Clough-Tocher interpolation scheme provided
 with the scientific computing package SciPy.
 The interpolation scheme finds the three neighboring points of the query
 point and uses a piece-wise interpolating Bezier polynomial with order
 of accuracy upto third degree.
 Since the procedure is computationally inexpensive and over resolution
 is used by setting the time stepping to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times10^{-7}s$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The streamline can thus be recovered for any selection of the source point
 in the flow field.
 However, to select a suitable point that would allow capturing the mean
 trajectory of the spanwise coherent vortices, the mean velocity magnitude
 distribution on a straight line across the shear layer near the slat cusp
 is used as shown in Fig.

 The point at the bottom of the dip in velocity magnitude correspond to
 the point immediately downstream of the slat cusp and this point is selected
 as the source point for the streamline integrator.

The obtained streamline is then used to quantitatively analyze the streamline
 curvature.
 Geometrically, the local curvature of a streamline is defined as the rate
 of variation of a unit tangent vector direction with respect to the arc-length.
 This definition allows to calculate the Radius of curvature in different
 forms as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
R & =\left\Vert \frac{d\vec{T}}{ds}\right\Vert =\frac{\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}{\left[1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}\right]^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the Radius of Curvature, which is the reciprocal of the measure of curvature
, 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\frac{1}{R}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the path length.
 Here, since we obtained the coordinates of the points of the streamline
 path, we choose the formula 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
R & =\left[\left(\frac{\partial^{2}x}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\partial^{2}y}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}\right]^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $ds$
\end_inset

 is the differential arc length computed as the first order gradient of
 flow path-length obtained by cumulative sum of the individual Runge-Kutta
 integrated steps for the path-length.
 The numerical computation of the local Radius of Curvature as a function
 of the streamwise location on the shear layer for the standard geometry
 is shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:localcurvature"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The calculation of gradients is particularly noisy for the calculation
 of the second order derivative along the streamline due to the interpolation
 and hence an additional averaging is applied using a moving window for
 the calculation of curvature.
 This averaging, with a window size of 100 points, reduces the numerical
 noise and delivers a smoother calculation in the early shear layer and
 also in the downstream where the mean velocity field is less converged
 due to the low frequency oscillations of the cove flow.
 For calculations using the second order gradient we report only the smoothed
 version of the obtained quantities.

The measure of curvature is the inverse of the Radius of Curvature, R.

As shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the deceleration on the streamline is far from uniform.
 The flow is first accelerated along the streamline in the initial region
 of the vortex shedding and as the streamline curvature decreases in the
 intermediate region, the flow is accelerated.
 Before the impingement near the wall, the stagnation causes a region of
 strong deceleration.
 This stagnation of the mean flow generates the necessary pressure gradient
 required to counter act the centrifugal force generated by the curvature
 of the flow.
 However, when the angular momentum decreases radially across the streamlines,
 the centrifugal force can be in excess of the established pressure gradient.
 This imbalance is the cause for the centrifugal instability.
 These perturbations then allow exchange of momentum along the radial direction
 by the transport of fluid thereby balancing the deficit in the pressure
 gradient to counteract the centrifugal force.
 This rapid generation of streamwise vortices is also enhanced by the degenerati
on of spanwise coherent vortices which have already entrained a portion
 of the recirculating streamwise vortices.

The location of maximum deceleration relative to the flow geometry is marked

.
 The position is not exactly on the slat trailing edge but slightly upstream,
 the exact location being dependent on the choice of streamline.
 Nevertheless, the marked position is the location of the maximum deceleration
 experienced by a fluid particle moving along the streamline and is hence
 the location of maximum momentum transfer.
 In view of the theory that impingement of vortices is responsible for the
 generation of acoustic waves that modulate the K-H shedding frequency at
 the cusp and thereby select the tonal noise frequency, this location must
 correspond to the length of the shear layer that predicts the tonal noise
 frequency.
 To understand this further we look at the actual velocity distribution
 along the streamline and compute the time of travel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time required for the spanwise eddy to reach the location of maximum
 deceleration can be obtained as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{S}=\int^{S}\frac{ds}{V(s)}$
\end_inset

.
 The total time is then obtained as sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{S}$
\end_inset

 and the acoustic propagation time from the location of impingement to the
 source point of the streamline.
 This calculation leads to total time of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.213\,\text{ms}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $824\,\text{Hz}$

To compare this frequency to the theoretical model, the tone prediction
 formula of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{n}=n\frac{U_{\infty}}{L_{a}}\cdot\frac{1}{\mathcal{M}+\frac{\alpha_{l}}{\kappa_{v}}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the acoustic path length, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{l}$
\end_inset

 is the ratio of length of the shear layer to the acoustic path between
 the impingement location and the cusp and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{v}$
\end_inset

 is the ratio of vortex convection velocity of vortices along the shear
 layer to the free stream velocity.
 Here, the vortex convection velocity is not calculable from a mean flow
 solution and for our study we resort to the value obtained for the same
 case by Terracol et al., i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{v}=0.79$
\end_inset

.
 Based on the location of maximum deceleration, the acoustic path length
 is obtained as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{a}=0.0326\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

, and the vortex path length along the shear layer as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{v}=0.0387\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

, leading to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{l}=1.187$
\end_inset

 The resulting fundamental tone corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$

 These frequencies are higher than the experimental tone frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $[1771,2655,3540,4425,\text{ and }5310]$
\end_inset

 slightly too early than the actual location of the acoustic generation.
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

's formula is highly sensitive to the computation of the shear layer path
 length, and hence on the location of the acoustic generation, lending high
 level of uncertainity in the tone calculation using this method.
 Moreover, for the same calculation, a correction of the convection velocity
 factor to

 His analogy of the streamline curvature with a stratified flow under the
 effect of buoyancy led to formulation of representative parameters.
 One of these, pertinent to interpretation of the slat shear layer, is the
 flux Richardson number.

 turbulent kinetic energy production between the radial direction and the

 while studying the stability of curved free shear layers in small curvature
 regime.
 The generation of vorticity in the streamwise direction, in their perspective,
 is an effect of the diffusion of the turbulent velocity perturbation into
 the streamwise direction led by the effect of the centrifugal force and
 hence arises from the requirement of inviscid stability.
 The flux Richardson number aids in quantifying the effect of this imposed
 vorticity transfer by taking into account the effect of the centrifugal
 force acting on the flow and also the local vorticity thickness by incorporatin
g the radial streamwise-velocity gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial n}$
\end_inset

.
 In this regard, we extrapolate the existing perspective as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well understood from the literature that the streamline curvature
 along a shear layer can lead to additional instability arising from the
 centrifugal effects.
 This leads to the generation of streamwise vortices across a wide range
 of Reynolds numbers.
 The effect of curvature is such that there is a generation of streamwise
 vorticity which is cumulative in the sense that this accumulation of streamwise
 vorticity happens as long as the Rayleigh criteria holds, i.e.
 with a reduction of the angular momentum radially outward from the center
 of curvature.
 The cumulative effect of this curvature can be captured by the total transfer
 of momentum due to the additional centrifugal force in action, or as the
 work done by the same.
 The instantaneous momentum transfer, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}$
\end_inset

, effected by the centrifugal force while the fluid traverses a curved path
 
\begin_inset Formula $ds$
\end_inset

 with a local radius of curvature 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, traversing with a streamwise velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, is equivalent to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d\Theta_{c}=\frac{U^{2}}{R}\frac{ds}{U}=\frac{U}{R}ds
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is the velocity component along the streamline, and in the vectorial sense
 of the centrifugal force, the direction of this momentum transfer is invariant
 as the direction radially outward from the center of curvature.
 The resulting term 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U}{R}$
\end_inset

 is hence the effective density of total momentum transfer due to the centrifuga
l force along the path length.
 Thus the curvature Richardson number of the form in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:curvatureRich"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 effectively capture the effect of the centrifugal force in its momentum
 transfer leading to the generation of streamwise vorticity.
 The same term is used in the curvature Richardson number together with
 the cross-stream velocity gradient, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}$
\end_inset

.
 In case that the shear layer has a strong velocity gradient such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}>>\frac{U}{R}$
\end_inset

, as in the early part of the slat shear layer, or in the case of a plane
 shear layer, the curvature Richardson number approaches zero.
 However, in the region where the shear layer weakens, and the curvature
 is finite such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}<<\frac{U}{R}$
\end_inset

, the curvature Richardson number will tend to increase and saturate at
 2.
 For the case of applying the linearized equations to study effects of a
 slightly curved free shear layers,

The computation of curvature Richardson number requires to calculate the
 strain rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}$
\end_inset

.
 For this we obtain the normals of the streamline on each point of the streamlin
e using a constant cell size.
 An over-resolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.5\times10^{-5}\,\text{m}$
\end_inset

 is maintained to avoid numerical discrepancies.
 A subsample of the streamline normals along the length of the streamline
 is shown in Fig.

 As can be seen, the initial values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}$
\end_inset

 near the slat cusp has an order of magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{4}$
\end_inset

 which reduces downstream due to the shear layer spreading.
 Streamwise locations after the streamline enters the recirculation is noisy
 again due to the low frequency oscillations of the cove requiring longer
 averaging time to be averaged out.

 The Richardson number can be seen to have a low value in the early shear
 layer due to the high value for the strain rate.
 As the shear layer spreads, the curvature Richardson number tends to increase,
 suggesting the strong momentum transfer due to the centrifugal force.
 In the mid-region, the curvature reduces as the shear layer inverts its
 direction of the curvature towards the unstable configuration, and the
 Richardson number hence drops.
 Afterwards, the curvature Richardson number increases as the shear layer
 spreads due to growth of the spanwise eddies along with entertainment of
 streamwise vortices.
 The curvature Richardson number then tend to saturate towards 2 in the
 region immediately downstream of the location of maximum deceleration,
 owing to the large value of curvature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The case considered here is the standard geometry with standard position
 of the slat with respect to the airfoil.
 This configuration showed strong presence of the broadband acoustic spectra
 and tonal noise owing to the fact that the spanwise coherence of the shed
 vortices from slat cusp is not fully disintegrated by the time of their
 travel towards the trailing edge.
 This owes to the fact that the curvature Richardson number rises to a strong
 value only near and downstream of the location of maximum deceleration
 suggesting that the flow did not accrue a large enough effect of the centrifuga
l destabilization, as it would have been the case if the flow developed
 a larger curvature Richardson number further upstream of the impingement
 location.
 This means that although the effect of centrifugal instability is substantial
 in generating the streamwise turbulence, it is not sufficient to cause
 a complete degeneration of spanwise coherence to disable the aeroacoustic
 resonance.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nevertheless, in the vicinity of the impingement location, the process of
 spanwise decoherence must be strongly dominated by the collision processes
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This means that the momentum transfer due to centrifugal force is weaker
 in this particular case when compared to cases whose slat positioning enables
 a higher distribution of Richardson number throughout the shear layer.
 This fact is reflected in the distribution of the curvature Richardson
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, since its value is typically low in the region of the early shear layer.
 The flow is also stable towards centrifugal instability due to the stable
 configuration of increasing angular momentum along the radius of curvature.
 The curvature Richardson number rises to a strong value only near and downstrea
m of the location of maximum deceleration suggesting that the flow did not
 accrue largely the effect of the centrifugal force, as it would have been
 the case if the flow developed a larger curvature Richardson number further
 upstream of the impingement location.

That being said, we now define a non-dimensional quantity that allows us
 to compare the effect of curvature for any given geometry of the slat shear
 layer, based only on the shear layer shape and mean flow distribution.
 For this we use a cumulative integral of the Richardson number along the
 shear layer, which can be formally written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M^{*}(l)=\int_{0}^{l}Ri_{f}ds
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
where 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 is the length along the streamline through the shear layer.
 For the given standard case, the cumulative curvature Richardson number
 as a function of the shear layer path length is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cumulativecurvaturerichardson"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For the given case, the cumulative Richardson number is at a value of approxima
tely 0.005 at the location of maximum deceleration.
 The accrual of Richardson number above this value sharply increases in
 the region downstream of location of maximum deceleration and it rises
 to 0.01 suggesting strong generation of the streamwise structures arising
 from the centrifugal effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are two things worth mentioning with regard to analyzing the curvature
 effect in this manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
First is that in the volume of region after the impingement, the effect
 of curvature instability is obviously large across the slat gap.
 However, this region is not only influenced by the curvature but by the
 effect of impingement itself.
 The effect of the latter towards the decoherence process can be assumed
 to be stronger given that it generates strong aerodynamic pressure fluctuations
 and vorticity generation.
 Hence it is not useful to use the curvature Richardson number after the
 location of maximum deceleration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The second is that the effect of curvature is obviously substantial.
 Hence the same can be used to qualitatively understand how the noise efficiency
 will change when shape of the shear layer changes.
 However, this is useful only if the impingement location is sufficiently
 close to the trailing edge with the shear layer shape upstream of impingement
 has variations.
 In such a case, a slower accrual of the curvature Richardson number can
 lead to a higher spanwise coherence of the spanwise eddies responsible
 for exciting the Rossiter mechanism and hence can deliver a strong resonance
 leading to noisy operation.
 In cases with an early impingement, as in the case considered by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 where they used a plug on the slat wall to cause variations in shear layer
 shape, the spanwise coherence will degenerate regardless of the curvature
 effects leading to reduced noise efficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That being said, before moving to a parametric analysis, let us look into
 the acoustics data available from the simulation in detail.
 We do not reiterate the far-field data obtained using FWH computation but

Acoustics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acoustic perturbations are essentially perturbations of the pressure field
 arising from compressibilty and translate to equivalent density perturbations.
 By the continuity equation, the density perturbation can be written in
 terms of the divergence of the velocity field as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Theta=-\frac{1}{\bar{\rho}}\frac{D\rho}{Dt}=\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{D}{Dt}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla$
\end_inset

 represents the material derivative and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta$
\end_inset

 is called the dilatation field
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ribner1964"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Within turbulent flows, the dilatation field has two components due to
 the hydrodynamic and acoustic fluctuations.
 The former are large magnitude perturbations that witness slight hydrodynamic
 compressibilty that might contribute or not to sound radiation whereas
 the latter are small magnitude perturbations that represents the propagation
 of sound.
 Although vastly differing in their order of magnitudes, separating the
 two is still a non-trivial procedure
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Ewert2021"

\end_inset

.
 But the emanating acoustic wave fronts can be identified in the region
 outside the turbulent region where sound generation is absent.
 The typical dilatation field around the HLD as obtained from the unsteady
 simulation is shown on the snapshot of Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Dilatation"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The wave fronts emitted from the slat cove are identifiable from the dilatation
 field towards both the suction side and the pressure side, latter being
 towards the ground observer.
 The major acoustic source region can be identified as the slat cove and
 the trailing edge of the main-element.
 The trailing edge of this HLD, must be recalled, is obtained by replacing
 a TE flap in order to reduce lift
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Hence the noise generation from the trailing edge is not covered in our
 study since it is found to have no interference with the slat cove acoustics.

 The radiation towards the pressure side is seen to radiate from the region
 close to the slat gap, and for the radiation to the suction side, the source
 appears to be located within the slat cove.
 There also exist a region with acoustic shadow in the upstream of the slat
 since the geometry shadows the radiation unless the wave number is small
 enough to enable diffraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dilatation field also has drawbacks visualizing data on the grids with
 refinement interfaces.
 At the refinement interface, the calculation of derivative introduces numerical
 errors, which are not necessarily unsteady.
 Hence the errors does not necessarily lead to generation of spurious acoustics
 but vitiates the acoustic field visualization.
 An improvement in this regard is hence possible by using an alternative
 definition for dilatation as the density rate.
 For isentropic fluctuations of small amplitudes in an otherwise quiescent
 media, the dilatation can be expressed as the rate of pressure fluctuation
 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ensuremath{\Theta=-\frac{1}{\rho_{0}}\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{0}$

 is the ambient mean density.
 The pressure rate being a temporal derivative also removes its local steady
 component.

 The acoustic field thus visualized shows majorly high frequency wavefronts

 This corresponds to acoustic waves of frequency higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $50\,\text{kHz}$$ $

 It hence suggests that the wavefronts visible in this visualization are
 also strongly vitiated by the high frequency numerical noise which are
 amplified by the temporal derivative.

From observing the dynamics of the filtered fields, the following observations
 can be made:
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Enumerate
The filtered field corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $885\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 has two dominant lobes near the impingement location as shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:filterpressure885"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is the location of maximum curvature where the streamline curves into
 the recirculation region.
 The two lobes on the either side of the location of impingement has opposite
 polarity and are coupled in their dynamics.
 The node between the two lobes appear to have a stationary location unlike
 a traveling wave for other frequencies.
 This suggests that this mode is not generated by the impinging vortices
 convected by the shear layer, but rather by a feature of the flow dynamics
 that is local to the impingement location.
 This is hence reasoned to be the low frequency steady mode fluctuation,
 as part of the steady spanwise mode found in the mean velocity fields,
 driven by the effect of strong curvature of the streamlines.
 Moreover, the opposing polarity of the two lobes suggest that there exists
 a strong oscillating pressure gradient.
 This pressure gradient leads to oscillation of the impingement location
 of the shear layer leading to a closing and opening of the cavity, which
 is enclosed by the shear layer on one side and the curved slat wall on
 the other side.
 Such an effect drives the fluctuation of the larger hydrodynamic pressure
 mode inside the cavity and due to the amplitude of oscillation will influence
 the vortex shedding frequency leading to a selection of common oscillating
 frequency between them.
 This process can hence be suspected to largely influence the frequency
 selection of the resonance frequencies, in addition to the Rossiter mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Dynamics corresponding to frequencies of other tones show similarities between
 them as shown in Fig.

.
 The tonal frequency reveal that they are traveling waves along the shear
 layer with the lowest frequency having the largest lobes.
 For higher frequencies, the lobes grow smaller, however traverses with
 a constant convection velocity of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $23\,\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

.
 These are hence attributed to the large scale spanwise coherent structures
 convected along the shear layer inducing their traveling pressure fields
 on to the flow.
 The impingement location instead of having lobes separated by the impingement
 location, have shapes aligned with the ejected streamline.
 These lobes are however present in pairs arranged along the cross flow
 direction suggesting that the mode of fluctuation induce motion of the
 ejected fluid normal to the slat trailing edge wall, and normal to the
 mean streamlines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The dynamics of acoustic waves can also be noted to be strongly coupled
 with large amplitude hydrodynamic oscillations.
 For all frequencies visualized, the acoustic fluctuations near the slat
 trailing edge is notably synchronized with pressure fluctuations of the
 impingement dynamics.
 The radiated wavefronts upstream of slat trailing edge outside the cove
 also have their center precisely at the slat trailing edge.
 For the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $885\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

, the center of radiation is more ambiguous due to the fact that the wavelength
 at this frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.38\text{m}$
\end_inset

, roughly one order of magnitude higher than the slat chord.
 Hence this tone, along with the other characteristics tones less than approxima
tely 
\begin_inset Formula $9\text{kHz}$
\end_inset

, cannot form a standing wave in the 2D plane of slat cove flow between
 the slat trailing edge and cusp.
 Consequently, the only standing wave possible in the low frequency range
 is the spanwise direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The tonal wavefronts for the higher frequencies are notably centered at
 the slat trailing edge with a directivity normal to the tangent of the
 upper wall.
 The trailing edge of the VALIANT geometry has a thickness of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.7\text{m}m$
\end_inset

 and is hence not exactly a pointed edge as in the case of the cusp.
 The directivity of the lobe agrees well with the observations in the literature
 that the tonal directivities follow dipole behavior, with the axis of the
 dipole normal to the slat wall at trailing edge.
 However, this is only an approximation since only the upper lobe at the
 trailing edge can radiate to the farfield and the lower lobe is partly
 reflected and partly shielded by the presence of the main element.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The hydrodynamic pressure in the slat cove for all tone frequencies of 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 and above extracted shows a spatially growing wave along the shear layer.
 These waves represent the pressure fluctuation induced by the convected
 vorticity of spanwise coherent structures generated near the cusp.
 The mode structures convect at the corresponding phase velocity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The hydrodynamic oscillation at the slat TE for 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 shows persistent elongated lobes along the shedding direction.
 These lobes represent pressure fluctuations that due to the vortex shedding
 and is responsible for the flapping motion of the shear layer at the slat
 TE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The acoustic fields show that a dipole like source can be safely assumed
 on the slat trailing edge.
 The radiated field can be clearly identified to have opposing phase centered
 at the slat TE.
 The axis of the dipole is also observed to be aligned with the local normal
 to the slat TE wall at the edge.
 The radiation towards the suction side can be identified to have dipole
 like radiation pattern, but the pressure side lobe is strongly distorted
 by the shape of the cove.
 The hydrodynamic component present at the TE also mask the acoustic radiation
 at the slat TE at the inner side making clearer discernment difficult.

For this, the pressure field is sampled at a rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $180405\,\text{Hz}$

 The probes are activated for the full length of the simulation to monitor
 convergence and only the part of signals after convergence are subjected
 to power spectral density calculation.
 The raw pressure signals from the probes are given in Appendix A.
 For the power spectral density calculation using Welsch method, we select
 a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $41000$
\end_inset

 steps and a window size of 
\begin_inset Formula $8200$
\end_inset

 steps with an overlap of 
\begin_inset Formula $50%\ensuremath{\%}

\end_inset

.
 This leads to a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $9$

 averaging windows and a linear trend line is used to remove the mean from
 each window to obtain the fluctuating component of the pressure.
 The PSD is then obtained with a resolution of

\begin_layout Plain Layout
From analyzing the data, the recordings from probes on the leading edge
 of the slat shows strong similarity with the far-field acoustic spectra.
 Probes 1, 3, and 5, shows the the first main tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 although with less sharpness than the second tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $2655\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

.
 The second and third tones are prominent and a steady decay for the higher
 frequencies are noted.
 Due to absence of a developed boundary layer or incoming turbulence, this
 pressure field is the incident acoustic field recorded by the wall pressure
 sensors.
 The same behavior can also be noted for probes 14, 16, 19, and 20, moving
 progressively from the trailing edge to the cove region on the pressure
 side of the main element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For probes inside the slat cove, namely, Probe 6, 8, 10, and 11, the obtained
 spectra shows a progressive behavior.
 The spectra for Probe 6 which is close to the slat cusp shows the second
 tonal peak at 
\begin_inset Formula $2655\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 as the dominant tone and the first tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 is shadowed by the low frequency fluctuations arising from the behavior
 of cove motion.
 This drowning of the tonal oscillations increases progressively towards
 the slat cusp, and for Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $11$
\end_inset

, the tones are completely dominated by steady noise from the impinging
 vortex structures.
 The overall low frequency noise below 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 also increases obscuring the hump at this frequency corresponding to the
 first Rossiter mode.

From inspection of data of Probe 6 and its replicates, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:probe6wallpressure"

\end_inset

, it can be noted that the spanwise modulations are reproduced in the low
 frequency part of the spectra particularly above 
\begin_inset Formula $200\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 and below 
\begin_inset Formula $1000\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

.
 The spectra in this region tends to have stronger levels for spanwise locations
 that correspond to pressure locations which are at the diverging plane
 of the spanwise velocity field.
 Probe 6 location being close to the slat cusp with spanwise modulation
 at low frequency verifies the hypothesis that spanwise nodal planes are
 stronger and driven by the initial curvature of the shear layer.
 It also further suggests that there are low frequency fluctuations particularly
 associated with such planes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For other probes, namely Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $7$
\end_inset

 which is adjacent to Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

, but deeper into the cove from the slat cusp, the spanwise modulation in
 the wall pressure spectra becomes less pronounced.
 This is expected from the shape of the spanwise velocity contours which
 shows that the cells near the slat cusp region is closer to the shear layer
 than the wall and also transition to the upper chain of cells as we move
 along the inner wall of the slat.
 The modulation again gathers strength for Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $9$
\end_inset

, also with a lowering of the low frequency contents.
 As we move further towards the impingement location with Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $13$
\end_inset

, the low frequency contents again becomes dominant due to the possible
 contribution from low frequency fluctuations associated with strongly curved
 flow at the impingement location.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the spanwise modulated behavior, the presence of the tones at

\begin_inset Formula $2655,$

 can be seen to be present irrespective of the spanwise location.
 The first tonal peak at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 however seems to be more susceptible to the spanwise modulations particularly
 for Probes 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $9$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $10$

 For the low frequency hump at 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,\text{Hz}$
\end_inset

 although for probes outside the cove, namely Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $5$

\begin_inset Formula $19$

The initial reduction of the low frequency fluctuations from Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

, placed at the highly curved flow region near the cusp, to intermediate
 probes and then gaining strength towards the impingement location again
 with highly curved flow due to impingement suggest that these fluctuations
 could be the result of modes driven by the centrifugal instability.
 Another possible reason can be that the concave wall geometry acts as as
 a reflecting surface that leads to partial focusing of the reflected pressure
 waves near such locations.
 Furthermore, from Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

 in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Now, from the presence of converging and diverging planes of spanwise velocity,
 it is possible that the fluid accumulates at the converging plane and has
 to be redistributed to the diverging planes by a dynamic mechanism.
 We hence how hypothesize that it is the periodic bursting of the early
 shear layer at the diverging planes that leads to this redistribution of
 fluid and in this process results in hydrodynamic pressure oscillation
 eventually leading the radiation of acoustic waves at this frequency.
 This mechanism therefore must be the most pronounced in the hot-wire measuremen
ts at the slat cusp if a spanwise investigation is enabled.

Various groups of probes are used to obtain the velocity fields near the

 Among these we first analyze the file placed near the cusp across the early
 shear layer, capturing the variation of turbulent velocity field from outside
 of the cove flow to its interior.
 For this, first the mean velocity magnitude is plotted as shown in Fig.

 The time-averaged velocity magnitude profile shown in Fig.

\end_inset

 concurs with the mean inflow velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $50\,\text{m/s}$
\end_inset

, and the deceleration due to presence of the main-element outside of the
 cove region.
 The mean recirculation velocity near the cusp is obtained as

 The velocity magnitude profiles are also largely spanwise invariant outside

\begin_inset Formula $\pm5\,\text{m/s}$

 inside the recirculation.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for the region inside the cove, the velocity switched signs with a peak
 amplitudes of

 velocity modulation along the span.

 The periodic oscillations are interestingly absent in the locations of
 the converging planes where the fluid is removed from the spanwise motion
 potentially entrained by the shear layer.
 This suggests that redistribution mechanism arising from presence of nodal
 planes tend to develop a low frequency pulsating behavior with which the
 initial shear layer bursts periodically.
 This low frequency bursting is also consistent with the behavior identified

Such a periodic bursting if present may affect the acoustics.
 Since the Rossiter mechanism is driven by the impingement of spanwise coherent
 vortices at the slat trailing edge, the retained spanwise coherence is
 a necessary factor for exciting a strong resonance.
 The periodic disruption of the spanwise coherence of the early vortices
 thereby affects the resulting acoustic tones through an amplitude modulation.
 Furthermore, for Probe 20, which is placed deeper into the cove inside
 the shear layer, the spectral content shows increased activity at the same
 frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $200\,\text{Hz}$

 Here the averaged spanwise velocity modulation is also with a higher amplitude
 approximately

The Rossiter mechanism is a dominantly 2D phenomena and a 3D aspect can
 potentially disrupt its efficiency.
 Thus a variation of the oscillation amplitude of the hydrodynamic field
 across the span suggest that the first Rossiter mode can be destructively
 affected.
 This is in line with the fact that the first mode has a lower power levels

 Moreover, the experimental studies assume that the flow in slat cove is
 dominantly 2D and examines wall pressure and hot wire probes at the spanwise
 center plane.
 This location in a symmetric setting can be reasonable assumed to have
 a diverging or converging plane for the spanwise velocity leading to concentrat
ion, rarification, and periodic behavior of the recirculated small scale
 streamwise structures.
 This will lead to erroneous evaluation of the turbulence and its spectral
 parameters.
 On the other hand, had the probes be placed in a plane corresponding to
 the center of a spanwise cell, the evaluated parameters would have been
 different for the first tonal peak.

 The effect is hence reasonably assumed to be the result of centrifugal

 This generates planes of convergence and divergence of the fluid mass.
 The fluid mass hence must be redistributed from the converging planes to
 the diverging planes to maintain mass continuity in the spanwise flow.
 However, in the peculiar configuration of a cavity flow bounded by a shear
 layer on one side, the velocity of flow outside the shear layer which entrains
 the fluid from the recirculation is at a higher velocity than the inner
 recirculation which plays the role of redistributing the fluid back to
 the diverging planes.
 Due to this difference of flow rates, the entrainment and removal of fluid
 mass is faster at converging planes and redistribution is slower in diverging
 planes leading to an imbalance of the mass continuity.
 This imbalance saturates periodically leading to a local bursting of the
 shear layer at the location of diverging planes, enabling mass transfer
 across the shear layer and leading to generation of streamwise oriented
 vortices in the process.
 The bursting hence periodically and locally disrupts the spanwise homogeneity
 of early shear layer in terms of spanwise vorticity and hence the spanwise
 coherence of the 2D K-H vortices.

\begin_layout Standard
One key ingredient in understanding the subsequent effects of such a cove
 bursting is in the fact that the bursting occurs at the diverging planes.
 Since the velocity is diverging, the generated streamwise vortices are
 convected either by the positive velocity or by the negative.
 By nature of turbulent flow, the bursting location is located more frequently
 at the center and hence the convection direction is selected in a stochastic
 manner.
 Consequently their location of impingement at the trailing edge of the
 slat also varies in the same fashion.
 This is precisely the phenomena noted in the recent work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wei2025a"

\end_inset

 where spanwise location of the tonal sources shows intermittent variations
 along the spanwise locations at the slat trailing edge.
 Our demonstrations hence provides a plausible explanation on what fundamentally
 drives this dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the Rossiter mechanism selects the frequencies based on the number
 of vortices that are shed which upon impingement are able to close the
 aeroacoustic loop.
 This means that if there is a periodic disruption of spanwise coherence,
 select Rossiter peaks would be affected depending on the frequency of the
 modulating oscillation, while the vortex shedding at other frequency multiples
 can remain intact.
 One direct evidence of such a periodic disruption of spanwise coherence
 is that the acoustic waves formed by impinging vortices which drives the
 Rossiter mechanism will show an amplitude modulation in time.
 The amplitude modulation will then lead to non-linear transfer of energy
 between the tonal frequencies, and is also a popular phenomena is slat
 noise, though unexplained.
 Here the first broadband hump which corresponds to the first Rossiter tone
 is weaker in the sound level compared to the second tone, and is not evident
 in the VALIANT experiment against installation noise.
 This peak also shows intermittent behavior according to

 A further investigation of the farfield spectra observed by

, within a frequency range of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta St_{s}=0.12$

 We here theorize that this appearance of shoulders for the broadband low
 frequency hump is the result of the first Rossiter mode (corresponding
 to the BB hump) being amplitude modulated.

Here, the Strouhal numbers for the Rossiter tones are dependent on the shear
 layer path length.
 Following the hypothesis that the low frequency oscillation is due to the
 effect of mass flow disparity, the Strouhal number for the low frequency
 oscillation is not necessarily linked to the shear layer path length but
 related to the difference of velocity, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta U=U_{0}-U_{i}$
\end_inset

, between the inner cove and the free stream and also to the length of spanwise
 cells 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, if the frequency of the cove bursting is 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B},$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B}\propto\Delta U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B}\propto\frac{1}{\lambda_{s}}$
\end_inset

 , then 
\begin_inset Formula $St_{B}\propto\frac{\Delta U}{\lambda_{s}}\times\frac{C_{s}}{U_{\infty}}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the spanwise cell wavelength is proportional to the slat chord
 as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula $St_{B}$

\]

where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}$

 is the velocity of recirculation.
 Hence Strouhal number for the bursting phenomena can be reasonably assumed
 to be dependent only on

\end_inset

, the velocity difference across the initial shear layer.
 Nevertheless a more rigorous approach on extracting a model for this Strouhal
 number requires precise knowledge of the dependence of spanwise cell size
 based on the slat chord.

Furthermore, from the inspection of data recorded from the high fidelity
 simulation, the vortex visualization enables to identify the cove bursting.
 For this, we increase the Q-criterion value used to obtain the iso-contours
 to obtain a smooth cover of the region of initial shear layer such that
 a bursting of this spanwise coherent isocontour, itself arising from the
 spanwise vorticity of the early shear layer, can be identified.

 It can be noticed that the spanwise coherence of the shear layer is burst
 in a quick burst of streamwise vorticity formation which is then convected
 along the shear layer.
 The generated vortices also gain a spanwise velocity corresponding to the
 position of the bursting, i.e.
 the vortices from the bursting are carried by the positive of negative
 spanwise velocity depending on the proximity of such vortices to the negative
 or positive velocity cells in the initial stage.
 This suggests that the position of the bursting is only approximately static
 in the very early shear layer, and towards the impingement location the
 location of vortices from the bursting can be highly chaotic.
 This is only of significance if there is a sufficient difference of characteris
tic between the region of vortices from bursting and the slurry of streamwise
 vortices already present towards the impingement location.

 The slat positioning was kept as standard.

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of the study was to investigate the details of data generated
 using unsteady 3D LBM for the slat cove flow and to revisit existing knowledge
 on its noise mechanism.
 In line with this, the unsteady visualizations of the cove vortices using
 Q-criterion was obtained and the behavior of spanwise coherent structures
 and their conversion to small scale streamwise structures were discussed.
 The generation of streamwise structures were shown to be possibly influenced
 by the curvature instability of the shear layer which augments the current
 understanding of their behaviors.
 Detailed visualizations were used to suggest that the vortices are generated
 from the outer periphery of the spanwise coherent structures and that a
 major fraction of the recirculated vortices are entrained and consumed
 by the spanwise coherent vortices from the early the shear layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On inspecting the mean flow contours of the velocity and pressure fields
 in the cove, the 2D flow components largely agreed with the existing knowledge
 of slat cove dynamics.
 However, the distributions of spanwise velocity rendered strong spanwise
 modulations which called into question the veracity of a spanwise homogeneous
 flow typically assumed for the configuration in both experiments and numerical
 simulations.
 The spanwise velocity modulation with amplitude upto more than 
\begin_inset Formula $10%\ensuremath{\%}
$
\end_inset

 of the mean stream velocity was observed in the simulation which used a
 spanwise domain length of more than 
\begin_inset Formula $5C_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.66C,$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the slat chord length and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is the stowed chord of the full HLD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To establish that the modulation is not an artifact of the simulation due
 to application of the periodic boundary condition, a simulation of the
 original wind tunnel geometry along with the lateral supporting plates
 were used.
 Here, the flow around the HLD was typically expected to be spanwise homogeneous
 in the region which is free from the influence of the wall in the experiment.
 But counter-intuitively this region was found to have a length of 0.2
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 However, the presence of spanwise modulations were also strongly disrupted
 by the presence of wall related turbulence for the rest of the span.
 Hence it is inferred that the presence of spanwise modulations is not a
 numerical artifact of the simulation but an effect of the centrifugal force
 due to the recirculating motion in the cove.
 To further the argument, two other simulations, one with a reduced span
 length by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

 and another with a subsized geometry with the chord scaled by a factor
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{3}$
\end_inset

 are also presented.
 Both the cases are also shown to retain the spanwise cell formation with
 the latter having a higher spanwise wave number for the modulations demonstrati
ng that the feature responds to the geometrical conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On further investigation of the mean flow distributions, it was inferred
 that the spanwise modulation of velocity leads to generation of converging
 and diverging 2D planes.
 At these planes, if we move along the positive spanwise direction, spanwise
 velocity switches signs.
 For those which switches the velocity from negative to positive are what
 we refer to as the diverging planes and they act as a source of the fluid
 for spanwise flow.
 The vice-versa is true for the converging planes which act as the sinks
 enabling entrainment of flow into the flow exterior to the recirculation.
 Such a configuration was shown to distort the pressure field in the cove
 such that the low pressure center of recirculation (time-averaged) generated
 due the centrifugal effect is not spanwise homogeneous, but deflected towards
 the shear layer at the location of the diverging nodal planes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spanwise variation of the velocity spectra for the spanwise component
 then revealed that there exists an oscillation at 200Hz, corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $St\approx0.156$
\end_inset

.
 These periodic oscillations since occurring at the diverging planes only
 at the early share layer can potentially affect the spanwise coherence
 of the shed eddies.
 Moreover, the streamwise vortices generated in this oscillation are convected
 towards both spanwise directions from the diverging plane in a stochastic
 manner.
 The latter phenomena is thus suggested as a plausible reason for recently
 discovered stochastic nature of the spanwise coherence location, trailing
 edge turbulence characteristics, and the non-linear interaction between
 the slat tones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, based on the above inferences, we suggest in this chapter that the
 spanwise modulation of the spanwise velocity present in the slat cove have
 a non-trivial impact on both the cove vortex dynamics and their acoustic
 signature.
 The problem of spanwise mode generation itself is sparingly attended in
 the fluid dynamics literature although the same has been noted, intrigued
 on, and partially characterized in the works including that of

.
 A further investigation of these phenomena is an interesting topic of future
 research and can be undertaken by fundamental analysis of the behavior
 of the Navier-Stokes equation under the effect of strong curvature of of
 a shear layer which bounds a region of recirculation.
 For its implications for slat noise, it is clear from this demonstration
 that experimental investigations which use 2D PIV and hotwire measurements
 at the spanwise center-plane will not be able to capture the spanwise mode
 formations.
 This explains why the stochasticity of slat Rossiter tones remained elusive
 of a reasonable explanation, and the discrepancies related to the tone
 frequency calculations and amplitude calculations from explanation based
 on Rossiter mechanism alone.
