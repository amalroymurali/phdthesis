Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 3D Lattice Boltzmann Method can provide a high fidelity description
 of sound-flow interactions and will therefore be applied to an in-depth
 analysis of the slat noise mechanisms.
 The ProLB solver with its advanced functionalities enable the recording
 of the flow field to sufficient resolution such that the turbulent structures
 and their dynamics in the cove can be visualized to great detail.
 Hence this chapter is dedicated to our investigation of the cove flow phenomena
 using the data collected during our simulation of a well documented experiment
 carried out in the European project VALIANT.
 This data is used to optimize the simulation and to validate it.
 The configuration is that of a 2-element geometry designed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 as detailed in Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, here with only the standard positioning of the slat with respect to the
 main element.
 This configuration has the slat coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $[\text{AOA}=18.0^{o},\text{SDA}=35.2\text{mm},\text{SGP}=7.94\text{mm},\text{SOL}=-6.36\text{mm}]$
\end_inset

 and will be referred to as the reference configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cove vortex dynamics has been studied to great detail using LES and
 RANS simulations and also by experimental investigations in the literature

key "Terracol2016,Choudhari2007,Wang2019,Wang2023,Zhang2024"

\end_inset

.
 The most agreed upon explanation of the characteristic slat noise is due
 to the presence of spanwise coherent vortices which are formed in the early
 shear layer near the slat cusp.
 These vortices are then convected towards the slat trailing edge where
 they undergo collision with the slat wall and deform such that their spanwise
 coherence is lost
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Manoha2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As a consequence, the ejected vortices has majorly streamwise orientation
 with only a portion of the spanwise coherence retained to cause the generation
 of acoustic waves which can close the aeroacoustic resonance loop
\color black
.
 In how much of this spanwise coherence can be retained at the impingement
 location is thus the determining factor for the presence of Rossiter tones
 and their strengths.
 Nevertheless, the mechanism of disintegration of the spanwise coherent
 structures are not studied widely and hence their effect on the noise generatio
n is not fully understood.

This is one aspect of the shear layer explored in this chapter by using
 LBM to simulate the flow in the reference configuration.

Our investigation in this direction lead to the fact that the curved shape
 of the shear layer has another important role to play in facilitating the
 vorticity transfer from the spanwise to streamwise directions.

The behavior of a curved shear also lead us to investigate the three dimensional
ity of the dynamics.
 Here, the curved shear layer acting as a boundary for a recirculating cavity
 has spanwise modulations which are known to have additional low frequency
 oscillations.
 Our investigation of the same in the cove recirculation region lead to
 uncover the formation of large scale spanwise structures.
 This showed that the spanwise modulations in the slat cove are not only
 at the scales of the small scale streamwise eddies formed at impingement
 but also at scales comparable to the slat chord length, leading to the
 formation of steady spanwise cells within the recirculation region.
 These cell formations were not known apriori in the case of slat cove dynamics
 although traces of the same can be noted as part of visualizations of cove
 vortices in the works of

 In the current chapter, we attempt to use the LBM solver to demonstrate
 the presence of this phenomena in the standard geometry and attempt to
 establish a relationship between the spanwise cell formation and the shape
 of the shear layer.

 This is a second aspect of the flow we try to explore in this chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin, we first validate the simulation framework for aeroacoustic computatio
ns by comparing its accuracy against experimental data using a standard
 geometry in a free-stream configuration.
 This serves as the baseline for the validation process.
 Next, we examine a case that includes the full installation effects and
 explain the differences observed in the results.
 Additionally, we present further simulation results based on variations
 of the same geometry, including one where the inlet velocity is reduced
 and another where the spanwise length of the simulation domain is shortened.

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Additionally we also include a few additional results from simulations of
 related cases to the same geometry, first by including the wind tunnel
 geometry and lateral side walls, second by reducing the inlet velocity
 and a third by reducing the spanwise length of the simulation domain, all
 demonstrating formation of the spanwise modulations independent of these
 parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In all of these cases, the three dimensionality is observed, demonstrating
 that such modulations occur independently of these parameters.

\begin_layout Section
Validation of standard case simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from validation case study detailed in the previous chapter
 based on the free stream conditions are detailed in this section.
 The convergence of the unsteady dynamics and mean wall pressure distributions
 are canonical measures of fidelity for the simulation and are discussed
 first.
 Subsequently, the probe data recordings are analyzed and finally the FWH
 computations discussed to validate the aeroacoustic capabilities of the
 solver.

An accurate capture of the flow dynamics and quantitative accuracies of
 the acoustic source phenomena are necessary to obtain a good agreement
 with experimental data.

\begin_layout Subsection
Convergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In LBM simulations the convergence is checked primarily by using the unsteady
 data recorded using numerical probes in the simulation.
 This is due to the fact that unlike conventional solvers, the LBM approach
 calculates a simulation time step without iterative procedures
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Feng2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Hence a useful monitor for the stationarity of the simulated aerodynamics
 is the unsteady forces on the solid geometries.
 ProLB enables to integrate the surface forces over the solid wall geometries
 using native functions and is deployed to extract the results.
 The force components which are in the direction of the X coordinate axis
 is taken to be the drag force and the one in Y direction is taken to be
 the lift force.
 These directionalities are not exactly accurate since the angle of attack
 of the main element is not aligned with the coordinate axes.
 Nevertheless, for convergence monitoring the directionality is not relevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recordings obtained are shown in Fig.

 The unsteady loading show satisfactory convergence after a total physical
 time of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05s$
\end_inset

 and the mean values are steady after 
\begin_inset Formula $0.075s$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second monitor is the unsteady data from critical locations of the flow.
 Here the slat cove dynamics can be monitored using the wall pressure sensor
 data.
 Raw data from a sensor placed inside the slat cove is shown in Fig.

Mean wall pressure distributions

 the two above mentioned simulations are compared against the experimental

 The case with the inclusion of the wind-tunnel shows a better agreement
 with the experiment for the attacking surface of the slat.
 This is due to the better capturing of the potential effect due to the
 airfoil near the nozzle exit where the exit flow is not uniform across
 the cross flow direction.
 In the full configuration simulation, the static pressure was not measured
 and the velocity was also not uniform, but with minor fluctuations (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1m/s$
\end_inset

 which has no measurable effect on the static pressure).
 This might be due to the fact that the static pressure is globally underestimat
ed in the free-field simulation.
 Hence the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 value at the leading edge of the main element can be seen to be weaker
 in the same case.
 For the free-flow case without the wind-tunnel and the lateral sidewalls,
 the suction pressure on the slat is higher than the experiment due to the
 uniform inflow condition whereas the suction pressure on the leading edge
 of main-element is also higher, however this time obtaining a better agreement
 with the experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the region inside the cove region and on the leading edge of main-element,
 the pressure coefficient for the free-flow case shows a reasonable agreement.
 The pressure on the main-element also shows a spatially local sharp peak
 which owes to the acceleration of the flow in the nozzle like shape of
 the slat gap.
 This acceleration is responsible for the high velocity ejection of the
 slat turbulence from the slat trailing edge and hence is likely to drive
 both the characteristic low frequency broadband noise and the high frequency
 noise.
\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although not conclusively, the acceleration is also responsible for the
 local disintegration of spanwise coherent vorticity which upon impingement
 drives the Rossiter oscillations.
 The differences of the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 hence can explain the difference of the generated noise in case of free
 flow from the experiment such that in the experiment, the suction peak
 is observed to be stronger and hence leading to stronger broadband noise
 levels.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From comparing the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 distributions, it can also be inferred that lift load on the airfoil is
 not captured with a good accuracy by the LBM simulation.

The experiment tend to have the highest lift load owing to the fact that
 the HLD generates a strong deflection of the narrow width jet, thereby
 generating a strong lift.
 In the simulations, both ones with and without the wind tunnel, the lift
 performance is observed to be reduced.

\color red
 
\color inherit
Moreover,
\end_layout

\end_inset

The angle of attack for the experiment is maintained at 
\begin_inset Formula $25^{o}$
\end_inset

 and for the corresponding simulation in free stream condition, the angle
 of attack is reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $18^{o}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a method to correct the change in the effective deflection.
 The equivalent angle of attack between the free stream case and the wind
 tunnel case was obtained empirically by matching the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

distributions from the free stream RANS simulations and actual experimental
 values in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The VALIANT HLD geometry was also obtained by replacing the flap of the
 base three-element configuration with a sharp trailing edge by keeping
 this equivalence of the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 distribution.
 Hence these equivalence is maintained for our study as well.

Unsteady Wall pressure data

The wall pressure data inside the cove represents the dynamics of pressure
 field inside the cove.
 This includes both the hydrodynamics and the acoustic perturbations and
 hence captures both large scale fluctuations due to the vortex behaviors
 and the acoustics including resonances.
 The shapes of the spectra present some features similar to those of the
 farfield in particular concerning the tonal peaks.
 The convergence of the signals also serves as a monitor for the convergence
 of the acoustic mechanisms.
 The PSD is calculated over a total time of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.23s$
\end_inset

 with a sampling frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $180405Hz$
\end_inset

.
 The total number of time steps allow a Welsh averaging window of 
\begin_inset Formula $8200$
\end_inset

 time steps and 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 averaging windows with 50% overlap resulting in a spectral resolution of
 
\begin_inset Formula $22Hz$
\end_inset

.
 The PSD is calculated using the routines provided by Python package 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

matplotlib.mlab
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and a detrending using a linear fit for the mean value is also used for
 each window together with smoothing of the domain edges using Hann window.
 For free-stream simulation, the data is collected over the full length
 of the simulation to monitor the convergence and is shown in Fig.

.
 (Details of the latter are provided in Appendix A).
 It can be noted that both cases show a reasonable agreement with the experiment
 regarding the tonal frequencies.
 For the SPL, the first tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

 tends to be better captured by the wind tunnel simulation whereas it is
 almost vanishing in most free stream curves.
 A good agreement can be seen in general for all higher frequency tones
 (not all harmonics) along with consistently higher broadband SPL in simulations.
 The higher SPL suggests that the pressure fluctuations in the cove are
 more energetic in the simulations than the experiment.

 The experiment and simulation which includes the wind tunnel installation
 geometries tend to have a better agreement of the average velocity data.
 In both cases, the velocity recovers to the free stream velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $50m/s$
\end_inset

 and show a mean recirculation velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $8m/s$
\end_inset

 on the cove side.
 In comparison, the flow in free stream simulation tends to develop a slightly
 weaker shear layer, with the free stream velocity recovering to 
\begin_inset Formula $43m/s$
\end_inset

 and the inner cove recirculation to 
\begin_inset Formula $12m/s$
\end_inset

.
 The velocity ratio between the inner and outer flows, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U_{i}}{U_{o}}$
\end_inset

, is thus 0.16 and 0.27 for experiment and free stream simulation respectively.
 This suggest that a perfect capturing of the shear layer thickness and
 strength requires the presence of the full installation.

A few factors can explain this disparity.
 In the free stream simulation, the incoming flow is homogeneous and laminar.
 Hence the development of the boundary layer and the turbulence therein
 are developed locally and instantaneous.
 On the contrary, the incoming flow in the experimental setup and simulation
 has multiple sources of turbulence upstream of the HLD, i.e.
 the shear layer of the nozzle generates a shedding of vorticity and spanwise
 plates that support the HLD develops a fully turbulent boundary layer upstream
 of the HLD.

The corner flow then allows this vorticity to be convected into the spanwise
 extend.
 From studying the mean flow field, only 
\begin_inset Formula $20\%$
\end_inset

 of the spanwise extend can be seen to the fairly unaffected by the corner
 flow and the rest of the spanwise extend is strongly turbulent.
 These differences between the free stream simulation and the experiment
 hence affect the vorticity thickness of the shear layer and hence the strength
 of shear layer.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The velocity ratio across the shear layer has an important role in determining
 the dynamics of the flow especially the acoustics.
 Among many, the primary effect is that it determines the strength of the
 Rossiter mechanism.
 The shed vorticity from the cusp leads to generation of the spanwise coherent
 eddies which excite the resonance and hence a reduction of the shear strength
 will weaken the resonance by weakening the shed vorticity.
 This agrees well with the diminished strength of the first tone in the
 free stream simulation as compared to the experiment.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another important aspect is that the velocity ratio may affect the strength
 of the centrifugal effect arising from the shear layer curvature and the
 recirculation.
 A detailed study of this aspect is presented in the chapter following this
 one and hence we restrict to a short mention.
 The centrifugal effect which is reasoned to the be driver of the spanwise
 mode formations inside the cove and its associated secondary low frequency
 fluctuations are linked to the difference between the inner cove flow and
 the outer high speed flow.
 The Strouhal number of these fluctuations leads the periodic disruption
 of coherence of the shed vorticity and hence modulates the first Rossiter
 modes via amplitude modulation.
 Hence, to maintain fidelity regarding the secondary flow and the acoustic
 features inside the cove, capturing the velocity ratio is important.
 Nevertheless, this secondary flow features and a possible amplitude modulation
 is a novel finding during this work and hence the numerical framework was
 not initially designed particularly to maintain fidelity regarding centrifugal
 effects and it must be so for future investigations.
 For the current study, the free stream flow is noted to have a difference
 of strength of the shear layer and recirculation, and is related to the
 differences obtained in the predicted acoustic spectra.
 Consequently, we proceed this thesis with this understanding of these possible
 disparities and utilize the compute optimizations obtained from a free
 stream configuration in comparison compared to a full scale simulation,
 for a more extensive parametric investigation of the cove flow phenomena.

The placement of FWH surfaces requires careful consideration for reasons
 detailed in the previous chapter.
 The primary challenge is positioning the surface to allow vortical structures
 to exit the computational region without crossing it.
 However, utilizing an open surface inherently reduces predicted pressure
 levels, as acoustic wave fronts from internal sources interact with the
 entire surface area, albeit with varying timing and amplitudes.This challenge
 is mitigated by spherical spreading, where wave amplitudes decay with increasin
g distance from the source.
 Consequently, surface regions far from the source contribute less significantly
 to the far-field observer measurements.
 This physical behavior allows positioning of the open surface sufficiently
 downstream from the main element while maintaining acceptable accuracy

To optimize surface placement and evaluate far-field sound contributions,
 we conducted multiple test cases.
 Our investigation began with an oval surface positioned close to the airfoil,
 which was progressively modified into a C-shape and enlarged to contain
 the ejected cove vorticity within the airfoil's suction side, thereby preventin
g spurious effects.
 While results from the oval surface testing are presented in Appendix A,
 we focus here on the optimal C-shaped surface configuration here.

 Their primary utility is in the open ended shape which allows the convected
 vortices to exit through the open side and since the open side can be kept
 sufficiently far, the radiation of the downstream eddies is expected to
 have a negligible effect onto the sound field regions that are upstream
 of the surface open end.
 In our case they also allow to avoid large size low vorticity structures
 on the suction side by careful placement.
 They also provide sufficient space to be confidently deployed to parametric
 case simulations such that when the slat positioning is varied, the increase
 or decrease of ejected flow will not necessarily cross the upper part of
 the surface, thereby enabling easier parameterisation.
 The C-surface placement plotted against the dilatation field around the

The mean pressure is however not same across the probes and a constant pressure

 The residual value of pressure reflects as the non-zero mean value of the

 sound since only the time derivative of pressure is used in the FWH formulation
 and not the absolute values.

 where they are compared with the spectra from the VALIANT experiment and
 another simulation of same kind but while including the wind tunnel installatio
n.
 The latter additionally includes lateral side plates and the converging
 duct which issues a jet, increasing the fidelity of the simulation towards
 the experiment.
 The comparison of results show a good performance of the numerical framework
 in capturing the far-field tones and the broadband characteristic slat
 noise.
 For an observer at 
\begin_inset Formula $-90^{o}$
\end_inset

 at the suction side of the airfoil, the prediction obtains the peak at
 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

, and the higher harmonics of the fundamental which is at 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the first Rossiter tone for this case according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Terracol2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For the fundamental at 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

, the experimental spectrum also misses the first tone primarily due to
 the fact that at frequencies of 
\begin_inset Formula $800Hz$
\end_inset

 and below, the installation noise dominates the acoustic field in the experimen
tal setup.
 In addition, the fundamental peak is a low level component that hardly
 peaks out of the main spectrum as a small hump.
 This suggests that the source radiation might be strongly distorted by
 the local large eddies resulting in a flattening and broadening of the
 associated peak.
 Nevertheless, the hump is visible at the upstream microphone on the pressure
 side, corresponding to Probe:9 at 
\begin_inset Formula $135^{o}$
\end_inset

 as seen in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Probe-9-1"
plural "false"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, we demonstrate in a subsequent chapter using a slightly adjusted
 position of the slat that this first peak can in fact be captured with
 stronger power levels in the same simulation setup and installation effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the first main tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

, which is the second Rossiter tone, the simulation faithfully reproduces
 the experimental frequency.
 However, the measured sound level is considerably higher at this frequency,
 which is not captured by the free stream simulation.
 In comparison, for the simulation that includes the installation geometries,
 especially the lateral side plates, the prediction leads to a better matching
 of the sound level.
 This suggests that the amplification of this tone can be due to the effect
 of the lateral side plates.
 Indeed, a spanwise resonance can be reasonably suspected to be present
 in the experiment.
 The experiment was designed with a span-to-chord ratio of 1, leading to
 separation between the plates to be 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3m$
\end_inset

.
 The fundamental tone for resonance between the plates is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{S0}=572Hz$
\end_inset

 whose second harmonic is at 
\begin_inset Formula $1716Hz$
\end_inset

.
 This is close to the 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the first harmonic of the cavity resonance.
 Furthermore, while comparing with the simulation that includes the spanwise
 lateral plates, both wall pressure recording and the farfield spectra show
 that the first tone obtained in the installed case is amplified with respect
 to the free stream configuration and hence reaches better agreement with
 the experiment.
 This supports the assumption that the disparity of the first tone is not
 an inaccuracy due to the simulation methodology but has a physical background.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Interestingly, in the further chapters of this thesis, this disparity is
 also explained further as due to the stronger development of the centrifugal
 effect of the cove recirculation in the case of a cleaner spanwise flow
 in the free-stream simulation.

For higher frequencies, the spectra downstream of the airfoil on suction
 side, i.e.
 Probe 0, show a better agreement.
 Microphones facing the suction side register higher levels for the frequencies
 above 
\begin_inset Formula $10kHz$
\end_inset

 which are possibly due to sources on the suction side of the HLD.
 Both turbulence ejection from the slat and its impingement on to the suction
 side of the airfoil leads to generation of high frequency noise.
\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, in the experiment, it is possible that the high frequency noise
 is attenuated by the presence of the jet shear layer and hence lower sound
 levels for the higher frequencies at farfield observer.
\end_layout

\end_inset

The obtained agreement between the simulation in free flow condition and
 wind tunnel experiment is hence reasonable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, as mentioned, the spanwise extend of airfoil is not the same
 in both experiment and simulation.
 For the experiment, the distance between lateral side plates is kept as
 1 chord length, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $C=0.3m$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand the simulation uses a chord length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.66C=0.2m$
\end_inset

.
 Theoretically, the experiment is designed to isolate a region between the
 plates which is unaffected by the boundary layer, the corner flow formed
 at the side plates, but an exact estimation of this region is not possible
 from the data with regard to the complexity of the installation effects.
 Hence a correction of the sound level corresponding to the spanwise length
 difference can not be considered.

Nevertheless, since the exact spanwise length that is acoustically active
 in the experiment is ambiguous, such a calculation is not trivial.

Unsteady data and cove dynamics

\begin_layout Standard
To study unsteady dynamics of the cove for the noise-validated standard
 geometry case, we used the Q-criterion visualization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hunt1988eddies"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to first isolate the vortices.
 The Q-criterion is defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Q & =\frac{1}{2}\left((\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})^{2}+|\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\Omega}}|_{2}^{2}-|\mathbf{S}|_{2}^{2}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is the instantaneous velocity vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

 is the strain rate tensor or symmetric part of the velocity gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$
\end_inset

 is the vorticity tensor or the anti-symmetric part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $|.|_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the Frobenius norm.
 The Q-criterion serves as a scalar which represents the domination of the
 vorticity component as opposed to the strain rate and in the space occupied
 by a vortex, the vortex core has a strong vorticity component with minimal
 strain (hence a larger Q-value) and vice-versa on the exterior.
 Hence, by choosing a suitable Q-criteria and obtaining the isocontours
 of the same, vortex structures can be identified given the 3D unsteady
 velocity field.
 To use the same, we use the internal calculator of the ProLB solver to
 record the Q-values along with the unsteady velocity field and extract
 the isocontours using the visualization software Paraview.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of Q-criterion depends on the application and a good visualization
 is obtained by iterative refinement.
 For our application, the Q-value of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.4\times10^{8}$
\end_inset

 was found to isolate the vortices in the flow as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 As an additional aid in visualization, we use one additional Q-value which
 is 70% higher than the first to obtain an isocontour of the vortex core.
 This allows to visualize the exterior of the spanwise rollers and their
 inner vortex core.
 The coloring of the isosurface aid in identification of dynamics associated
 with the vortex.
 Here we color the same using the vorticity value which aids in identifying
 the core from the exterior surface.
 The spanwise vorticity behavior can then be isolated by setting the transparenc
y settings in order to selectively highlight the vorticity based on the
 vorticity component on the isocontours surfaces.
 By using the spanwise vorticity as the coloring criteria and for transparency,
 the spanwise rollers shed from the slat cusp can be clearly identified
 as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 As expected, the spanrollers can be noted to have a strong spanwise coherent
 vorticity in the the vicinity of the slat cusp with progressive dispersion
 until the mid shear layer where the sense of curvature of the shear layer
 reverses.
 By sense of curvature we refer to the fact that the low speed recirculation
 region is on the concave side of the mean shear layer.
 Once the sign of curvature changes, i.e.
 the low speed flow is on the convex side of the curvature, the spanwise
 vortices can be noticed to disintegrate strongly by generation of smaller
 streamwise vortices primarily formed from the periphery of the spanwise
 structures, leading to the ejection of majorly streamwise vortices through
 the slat gap as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SpanwiseRollers-1"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 It must be mentioned that in addition to the streamwise vortices, this
 case also has comparatively similar, although less amount of residual spanwise
 vorticity that passes through the slat gap.
 This residual spanwise vorticity is a necessary component for the generation
 of the aeroacoustic phenomena since the streamwise vortices are far less
 efficient than spanwise coherent vortices to generate acoustic waves due
 to trailing edge scattering.

, made available as the supplementary document to this thesis, reveal that
 the process of generation of the streamwise vortices in the current case
 is particularly near and after the region where the curvature of the mean
 shear layer switches signs.
 This fact however does not allow to clearly state that the transition of
 vorticity is definitively due to the effect of curvature.
 This is due to the fact that the region near the slat gap is a region of
 both streamwise acceleration and deceleration of the mean flow.
 The acceleration is due to the nozzle like shape of the region leading
 to the slat gap while the deceleration is caused by the stagnation region
 due to the impingement.
 The area of impingement region generates a zone of stagnation for the mean
 flow which further reduces the area available for the flow to exit, aggravating
 the nozzle effect of the geometry further.
 This complex interaction of the dynamic forces of the fluid hence makes
 it difficult to state that the vorticity transition is definitively driven
 by the curvature effect alone.
 Nevertheless, it is clear that the major source of the streamwise vortices
 is by the transition from the spanwise coherent structures along the later
 stages of the curved shear layer.
 Additionally, the curved wall of the inner slat is susceptible to the well-know
n Görtler instability of concavely curved boundary layers

, and are potentially contributing to the generation of streamwise structures
 in the recirculation particularly close to the slat cusp whose inner wall
 has a strong curvature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another notable feature of the unsteady flow is the uneven distribution
 of the recirculation vortices inside the cove region as seen in both Fig.

.
 The streamwise vortices which are more populous tend to be sparse in the
 region close to the mid trajectory of shear layer and at the center of
 recirculation whereas the density is higher along the curved inner wall
 of the slat.
 The streamwise vortices that reach the impingement location are inevitability
 stretched along the wall due to the streamwise accelerated ejection and
 the stretched vortices disintegrate into smaller vortices as they enter
 the recirculation.
 These smaller vortices then move along the wall and experience the centrifugal
 force due to the curved streamline thereby being pushed radially outward
 from the center of circulation.
 The centrifugal force hence explains the tendency of the vortices to stay
 in the outer periphery of the cove recirculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recirculating streamwise structures also reach the slat cusp by moving
 along the inner slat wall.
 These structures can be noted to interfere with the shear layer in the
 region near the slat cusp and also in the early shear layer.
 The structures then interfere with the spanwise vortices accelerating the
 generation of more streamwise vortices in the process.
 This also aggravates the fact that the streamwise vortices are sparser
 in the mid-region of the slat shear layer since a major portion of the
 recirculated streamwise vortices are entrained into the shear layer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vortex stretching happening at the trailing edge is also worthy of further
 mention.
 The impinging vortices in the shear layer is a mix of streamwise and spanwise
 vortices with streamwise vortices in larger proportion.
 The latter majorly wind around and form ladder structures together with
 the spanwise structures.
 Near the wall at impingement, the streamwise vortices become stronger and
 assimilate to larger structures, and, as they impinge, the streamwise structure
s are elongated in the both the forward and backward directions, towards
 the ejected and recirculated directions respectively.
 Here the stretching is stronger in the downstream direction through the
 slat gap.
 The streamwise vortices in the slat wall are continuously reinforced with
 incoming vortices and as they interact with the wall they also tend to
 roll on the plane of the wall.
 This leads to counter rotating vortices finding themselves adjacent to
 each other leading to generation of large counter-rotating vortex pairs.
 These counter rotating vortex pairs can be visualized by using a diverging
 colourmap that highlights the streamwise vorticity in opposing directions
 as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:streamwisevorticesredblue"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The ejected counter rotating vortices and residual smaller streamwise vortices
 are then flushed on to the suction side of the main element.
 The counter rotating pairs often undergo further instability to form helical
 structures before impinging with the suction side wall on main element
 and can noticed in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:streamwisevorticesredblue"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The mean streamlines ejected from the trailing edge location need not necessari
ly directly graze the main element.
 However, in the unsteady dynamics, the ejected vortices tend to have an
 unsteady oscillation which redirects the ejected vortices to have a flapping
 motion towards and away from the main element suction wall.
 This low frequency oscillation leads to oscillation of the reattachment
 point of the ejected streamwise vortices on the main element.
 This low frequency flapping is found to have pressure oscillations correspondin
g to the first Rossiter mode as will be discussed in this chapter later.

 As shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the unsteady pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $P'=P-P_{0}$
\end_inset

, is seen to have periodic fluctuations along the shear layer trajectory
 representing the convection of vortices shed periodically from the cusp.
 Accompanied by their impingement on the wall near TE, the oscillating pressure
 field also exerts its influence over to the leading edge of the main element.
 Hence the hydrodynamic pressure in the slat gap has periodic fluctuations
 synchronized with the pressure fluctuations due to the convected vortices.
 From the 2D visualization at mid-span, the pressure inside the cove region
 also appears to have an oscillating component of considerably lower frequency
 than other stronger fluctuations of smaller length scales.
 From such a distribution of the periodic pressure fluctuation, it is hence
 expected that the shear layer modes would be particularly dominant in a
 model order reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
 (POD) or Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD).
 However, since these fluctuations are purely hydrodynamic, an inference
 of the acoustic interactions in the slat cove would still be difficult
 unless the hydrodynamic and acoustics modes are explicitly segregated.

The unsteady velocity field can shed further light on the three-dimensionality
 of the flow which is not evident from the pressure fields.
 But before elaborating on this, we first plot the unsteady velocity components
 on a colormap suited to highlight the macro flow features outside recirculation
 zone.
 As seen in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Velocity-Magnitude"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the velocity magnitude highlights the flow topology as the fluid accelerates
 through the slat gap.
 The ambient/inlet velocity of the simulation is at 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{0}=50\thinspace ms^{-1}$
\end_inset

, which is accelerated upto a maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $105ms^{-1}$
\end_inset

 in the region downstream of the slat trailing edge as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-unsteady-velocity"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This acceleration is due to the nozzle effect of the slat gap.
 Another prominent feature to be noticed is in the velocity components.
 In Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Velocity-Y"

caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it can be noticed that the major unsteadiness is confined to a region
 close to the slat TE while the major area of the slat gap still have a
 steady flow.
 This suggest that the ejected vortices, which are understood to be majorly
 streamwise structures, tend to primarily graze the surface of the slat
 trailing edge and the leading edge of the main element experience a smoother
 flow.
 The unsteady velocity components also tend to suggest uneven distribution
 inside the slat cove and are generally consistent with the effects of flow
 redirection through slat gap from the pressure side.
 This can be noticed in the broader distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{X}$
\end_inset

 inside the cove region and the same same for 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{Y}$

 around the mid-length of the shear layer.

 By definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{U_{Z}}=\frac{U_{Z}}{\sqrt{U_{X}^{2}+U_{Y}^{2}}}$
\end_inset

, serves as a quantity to identify the significance of the spanwise component
 or as a degree of three dimensional dynamics.
 It can be noted in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:VelocityRatio"

\end_inset

 that the 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{U_{Z}}$
\end_inset

 is majorly positive in the lower part of the cove and have an opposite
 sign in the upper region.
 By nature of 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{U_{Z}}$
\end_inset

, this indicates that both 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{z}$
\end_inset

 is significant compared to the inplane velocity and that its direction
 reverses in different regions of the cove.
 This feature is however slightly vitiated by the unsteadiness of the recirculat
ing vortices but is a clearly demonstrable feature with a sharp boundary
 for the sign reversal while analyzing the time-averaged fields.

.
 Also note that the point of stagnation on the pressure side of main element's
 leading edge does not have a local spike in value of 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{U_{Z}}$
\end_inset

 since at this point, the flow is redirected within the plane with no significan
t flow in the spanwise directions.
 This contrasts with the effect inside the cove where there is no region

\begin_inset Formula $R_{U_{Z}}\approx0$
\end_inset

, thus suggesting strong 3-dimensionality of the cove dynamics.

Time-averaged flow fields

Given that the unsteady dynamics has an array of interesting features worthy
 of further exploration, it is important to understand the time-averaged
 fields in tandem.
 The mean flow field convects the fluid and its vortices to establish the
 macro-flow features like the accelerated flow through the slat gap and
 the recirculation region.
 Within this configuration, the unsteadiness can be thought to be introduced
 by generation of vorticity due to the presence of slat cusp or the shear
 layer.
 These vortices then develop unsteady dynamics which leads to the aeroacoustics.
 Hence the vortex dynamics itself is intrinsically first determined by the
 established mean flow.

 in terms of the Coefficient of Pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 The mean pressure, as can be noted, drops significantly near and downstream
 of the slat gap leading to a negative spike.
 This suction peak is one of the reason that enhance the lift performance
 of the wing by addition of the leading edge slat.
 Looking more closely on to the slat cove, the visualization is made in
 terms of the primitive variables with a tailored color map in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The region of impingement is distinctly identifiable as a region of high
 pressure due to the partial stagnation of the flow and hence the reduction
 in the flow area through the slat gap.
 It is also evident that the low pressure core of the cove due to recirculation
 is not exactly at the center of recirculation itself but shifted nearer
 to the shear layer.

 This suggest that the cell formation or the spanwise dynamics may be a
 periodic phenomena which are being numerically averaged out in time but
 with a lower frequency than to be sufficiently removed within 5 chord pass
 times.
 Due to the this peculiar behavior and being previously not widely documented
 in the literature, we proceed to a slightly more detailed investigation
 of the same by looking at the unsteady and steady dynamics on a spanwise
 cut-planes inside the cove.

 The spanwise velocity is then visualized on this plane with suitable colourmap
 to identify the sign of spanwise velocity.
 As can be noted, spanwise velocity distribution is far from homogeneous
 along the spanwise plane.
 The `spanwise cells', as we like to refer to the region of same velocity
 direction, appear to be stacked periodically with alternating signs.
 The magnitude of mean spanwise velocity is close to

\begin_inset Formula $U=50\,ms^{-1}$

 These cells are also of length scales of the same order of the spanwise
 domain length, which for the current case of standard slat positioning
 generate a total of 6 cells, or 3 pairs of alternating signs.
 Their average spanwise cell size is hence 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{cell}=L_{span}/6=0.2/6=0.033\,m$

The cell formations tend to maintain the same cells size along the spanwise

 for the sign of the spanwise velocity, i.e.
 along the shear layer length, the arrangement of the cells are such that
 they oppose in signs between the cells attached to early shear layer and
 later shear layer.

\begin_layout Standard
The spanwise modulations and their obscurity in slat noise literature lead
 us to many interesting thoughts of which the following three are worthy
 of mention here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First is that the alternating time-averaged spanwise velocity means that
 there exist static nodal planes towards which the flow can converge and
 diverge from.
 Those planes whose both sides have spanwise velocity such that it decreases
 from positive to negative along the spanwise direction and hence have the
 flow directed towards the plane will be a `converging plane'.
 The other type of planes where the spanwise velocity increases from negative
 to positive necessitating the flow to diverge from the plane are the `diverging
 planes'.
 Since these planes act as sources and sinks for the spanwise dynamics,
 they must facilitate the interaction of the spanwise dynamics with the
 2-dimensional dynamics in the streamwise direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Second is that if such nodal planes exist, it is necessary that there must
 exist a mechanism to redistribute the fluid from the converging planes
 and to replenish the diverging planes continuously to establish a steady
 dynamics.
 Here, we have already seen that the recirculating small scale streamwise
 vortices are absorbed into the shear layer in regions near the mid trajectory.
 This suggest that for a converging plane, the mechanism to redistribute
 the fluid is by entertainment of flow along with the streamwise structures
 into the shear layer, which must also lead to higher concentration of streamwis
e structures in the spanwise direction at the locations of the converging
 planes.
 There must also be a lower concentration of the streamwise structures in
 the diverging planes.
 Nevertheless, this may not be a major phenomena easily observed in a largely
 turbulent state at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=10^{6}$
\end_inset

 with constant generation, distortion, and redistribution of vorticity,
 as in the slat cove.

The driving factor for the spanwise modulations should be the result of
 a dynamic instability either due to the shear layer geometry or due to
 the recirculating flow.
 Similar spanwise modulations are documented for flow over a backward facing
 step by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Their work categorically demonstrated the existence of large scale spanwise
 modulations in the shear layer due to the presence of a backward facing
 step.
 Their work argues that the spanwise modulations are the result of an absolute
 convective instability owing to the closed loop streamline in the recirculation
 bubble leading to generation of steady spanwise modes.
 The eigen functions identified in their work using the linear stability
 analysis of a simplified flow configuration, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:barkleyspanmodes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, predicts the spanwise wavelength with same order as that of the cavity
 depth.
 This is consistent with the observation that the spanwise cells in the
 slat cove have a wavelength with same order as the slat chord.
 On comparing the rectangular flow cavity with the slat cove, the cavity
 depth is analogous to the diameter of the recirculating cove flow, and
 this diameter is approximately the slat chord.
 Their study also suggest a critical Reynolds number, although at a low
 range of 
\begin_inset Formula $Re_{c}=748$
\end_inset

, from which the spanwise modulations are dominant and this critical Reynolds
 number is also argued to be decreased when a lateral side wall is present.
 In the case of simulations with spanwise periodic conditions mimicking
 an infinite spanwise domain, the critical Reynolds number is also increased.
 The case of slat cove dynamics is at a Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 based on the mean flow and if considering the flow inside the cove region,
 taking the mean velocity to be 
\begin_inset Formula $20m/s$
\end_inset

, and the characteristic length scale to be the slat chord 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}=0.039m$
\end_inset

, corresponding Reynolds number is at 
\begin_inset Formula $54000$
\end_inset

.
 This regime is still two orders of magnitude higher than that required
 to trigger the convective instability.
 The presence of spanwise walls are also of much importance for the slat
 cove flow as well, since, in our simulations we employ periodic conditions,
 and in experimental studies the lateral side walls are necessary to support
 the HLD mockup in the wind tunnel.
 Hence, drawing parallels between the fact that the flow over a backward
 facing step is much similar to the shear layer geometry of the slat cusp,
 particularly due to the fact that the slat cove also has one side bounded
 by a shear layer and both have a recirculation bubble in which the spanwise
 modes tend to dominate, we suspect the same mechanism is also in action
 in the slat cove dynamics.

 For the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Neary1987"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, three regimes of flow for an open rectangular cavity based on the Reynold's
 number was identified.
 In the first, there is a strong interaction of the shear layer with the
 recirculating vortex inside the cavity.
 In a second regime of higher Reynolds number, the interaction leads to
 intermittent behavior leading to a bursting phenomena where the recirculating
 vortex tends to oscillate in size leading to it bursting through the shear
 layer to release vorticity.
 While doing so, the flow is said to be strongly turbulent.
 In the third regime typically at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=33500$
\end_inset

, (for our low speed cove recirculation, 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=54000$
\end_inset

), the bursting oscillations and associated pressure oscillations become
 more frequent but irregular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the later work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the rectangular cavities were further analyzed using three-dimensional
 global instability analysis to show that the spanwise instability wavelength
 scales proportional to the cavity depth.
 The resulting spanwise modulated flow also develop oscillations that can
 induce a low frequency pulsation of the recirculating vortex.
 This frequency was deduced to have one order of magnitude lower than the
 Rossiter oscillations.
 The dependence of the growth rate of the spanwise modes with Reynolds number
 was also identified along with a critical value that would trigger the
 formation of the spanwise modes.
 However, the most interesting argument made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 was that the spanwise instability was a result of the curvature of the
 flow, i.e.
 the curved streamline of the recirculating vortices in the cavity would
 lead to a centrifugal instability that is different from the Rossiter oscillati
ons and the Görtler type instability that occurs on curved boundary walls.
 This argument finds its strength from the fact that the location of strongest
 spanwise modulation is in the region of strong curvature of the recirculation
 bubble on the downstream corner of the cavity.
 The spanwise modulated recirculation vortex would develop also a low frequency
 oscillation, and this additional oscillations can interfere with the Rossiter
 modes to modulate both its frequency and peak amplitudes.
\end_layout

That being noted on the spanwise mode formations, the same argument, along
 with the fact that for both the shear layer on a backward facing step and
 the recirculation streamline in open cavity flows have, in common, a curved
 streamline with one side bounded by a shear layer, we choose to investigate
 the case of slat cove dynamics in terms its peculiarities arising from
 curved streamline path of its shear layer.
 In line with this hypothesis, the behavior of a curved shear layer was
 also studied by

.
 His work studied the linear inviscid hydrodynamic stability of a slightly
 curved free shear layer.
 The study compared the cases of a stably curved and unstably curved shear
 layer identifying sensitivity of the flow to the addition of curvature
 to an already present shear layer.
 The formation of Görtler vortices was identified as a possible reason for
 the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs while
 the unstably curved regime is present.
 The work also provides a non-dimensional parameter, the curvature Richardson
 number, to quantify the effect an accelerated generation of streamwise
 vortices and will be used for comparison in our study as well.

From the above-mentioned array of ideas, we tend to theorize that the slat
 cove dynamics at the current Reynolds number has the following features
 and explanations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slat shear layer formed due to the difference of velocity between the
 free-stream and the recirculation vortex leads to the canonical Kelvin-Helmholt
z (K-H) instability as well identified in the literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Terracol2016,Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The saturation of K-H instability leads to the generation of 2-dimensional
 spanwise coherent structures being shed periodically from the cusp.
 If these vortices were to be convected in a straight line path, their behavior
 would only have the peculiarities of a vortex convected through an accelerated
 flow.
 However, since the established mean flow is such that the streamlines are
 curved along with the shear layer to facilitate flow through the slat gap,
 the vortices also follow a curved trajectory.
 This curvature of the streamline necessarily have a mean diameter of curvature
 similar in magnitude to the slat chord length.
 The spanwise coherent vortices which undergo such strong curvature experience
 an additional centrifugal force.
 Here, the pressure distribution inside the slat cove is lower than the
 pressure outside the cove region due to the fact that the region outside
 the slat cove is at the pressure side of the main element and is affected
 by presence of stagnation point on the main-element.
 Hence, the pressure gradient along the shear layer is positive along a
 radius of curvature of the shear layer with center of rotation inside the
 cove.
 This radial pressure gradient opposes the centrifugal force thereby requiring
 a balancing of these forces to enable a stable flow.
 This is the classical requirement for a dynamic instability to occur where
 two opposing forces which are supposed to be balanced are, in reality,
 not exactly and dynamically balanced, thereby leading to large growth rate
 for certain class of perturbations.
 Here, for the case of slat shear layer, the recirculating flow bounded
 by the curved shear layer is hence susceptible to the curvature instability
 leading to the typical steady spanwise modes primarily attached to the
 shear layer as described by

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Velocity-Magnitude-Mean-Cove"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it can be noticed that for the early part of the shear layer, the lower
 velocity flow is on the concave side of the shear layer curvature.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, this is a stable curvature since according to Rayleigh criteria, the curvature
 instability happens only if the angular momentum decreases radially outward.
 In early shear layer, the streamline velocity is increasing radially outward
 from the cove center and hence the curvature instability is stabilized.
 Furthermore, as inferred by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the initial K-H instability may also be stabilized partially leading to
 a reduced growth rate of the streamwise perturbations suggesting a delayed
 spanwise vortex generation due to the effect of curvature.
 Hence, in this regime, the major noticeable dynamics are a delayed generation
 of K-H vortices as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 together with the large spanwise modulations arising from the convective
 instability of the recirculation from the suggestion of

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the flow progresses downstream, the shear layer weakens due to its spreading
 and growth of spanwise vortices.
 Simultaneously, the radius of curvature also decreases to eventually reverse
 its sign.
 Once the sign of curvature reverses and strengthen near the vicinity of
 the slat trailing edge region, i.e., the streamlines curve such that the
 low pressure area of the suction peak on the main element is again on the
 concave side of the streamlines near the slat gap, and the high pressure
 region generated due to the impingement of the shear layer on the slat
 trailing edge is on its convex side.
 This reversed configuration of pressure gradient is again opposing the
 centrifugal acceleration facilitating curvature instability again.
 However, unlike the early shear layer, the velocity field can be noticed
 to have the high velocity stream on the concave side of the curvature.
 This according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is the unstably curved configuration and satisfy the Rayleigh criterion
 to have centrifugal instability.
 Hence the shear layer now develops a strong centrifugal instability leading
 to the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs.
 This generation of small scale structures are strongly accelerated by the
 presence of the ingested vortices from the recirculation region.
 It must be clearly noted that the regime of flow near the slat trailing
 edge is the asymptotic case for the linear stability analyzed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 whose conclusions are only directly valid for a curved free shear layer
 with small curvature.
 The effective range of curvature Richardson numbers for their analysis
 is of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 where for the slat shear layer, these are saturated near its value of 2
 as we show in the upcoming session.
 Hence, for the later part of the shear layer near the impingement location
 and flow through the slat gap, the major phenomena is the curvature instability
 driven by a considerably lower radius of curvature with a mean velocity
 distribution enabling a fully unstable configuration.
 The only noticeable effect is hence the generation of streamwise oriented
 counter rotating vortex pairs which assimilate into larger streamwise vortices
 on the slat trailing edge and are elongated and ejected through the slat
 gap.
 The terminology used in the recent literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wang2019,Wang2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that these are `Görtler like' transition is hence logically valid, although
 there is not curved boundary layer as in the case of the canonical Görtler
 transition that leads to small scale streamwise oriented structures.
 Note that since this is a purely centrifugal instability, meaning that
 this generation of streamwise structures would happen even if there was
 no supply of spanwise coherent vortices in the impinging shear layer.
 This is precisely the case reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wang2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, where at low enough Reynolds numbers, the periodic vortex shedding from
 the slat cusp is suppressed, possibly due to the combined effect of the
 stabilization of K-H instability due to curvature and the low Reynolds
 number, and the only noticeable turbulence generation is that of the streamwise
 vortices near the trailing edge.
 This hence reasonably described the dominant dynamics of flow through the
 slat gap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, inside the recirculation, the flow developing spanwise modulation
 was previously unidentified in the literature although it was noticed early
 that the vorticity ejected from the slat gap had spanwise modulations.
 The flow in the cove region was largely analyzed under the assumption that
 it is spanwise homogeneous, and at this point of understanding the cove
 dynamics, it is striking why the prediction of cove flow and related acoustics
 remained elusive from a perfectly predictive modelling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Souza2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This we suggest is due to the fact that the three dimensionality of the
 flow due to the spanwise modulation would induce additional oscillations,
 suggestively with frequency one order of magnitude lower than the first
 Rossiter tone, which can modulate the tonal frequencies and the amplitude
 of the peaks as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This tone, or more precisely a broadband hump in the low frequency was
 clearly identified in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, who characterized the same as having a different source mechanism compared
 to other tones.

 turbulent region like that of the slat cove and flow around the airfoil
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Clair2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, together with the fact that the intermittent bursting phenomena associated
 with oscillation of the recirculation vortex can both significantly broaden
 the frequency bandwidth of fluctuations effected by this mechanism on a
 far-field microphone.
 This broadband hump is also in the low frequency range which is also dominated
 by the measurement noise from the experimental setup and noise from the
 shear layer of the open jet wind tunnel, adding to their elusiveness.
 Thus when tonal character of slat noise was rightly identified as those
 related to the Rossiter mechanism by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, their modulation mechanism was overlooked due to the assumption of the
 spanwise homogeneity and thereby the choice of methodology for both experimenta
tion and numerical studies so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, before moving on to further discussion of the unsteady data related
 to the acoustics, we take a light detour to showcase a few additional simulatio
ns to establish that the formation of spanwise modes are not purely an artifact
 of the numerical simulation.
 This is evident from the fact that the same phenomena is observed in both
 flow over a backward facing step

 Nevertheless, our simulations serve to shed more light on the same in the
 particular context of slat cove dynamics.

\begin_layout Standard
To demonstrate that the formation of spanwise modes is not an artifact of
 the simulation or the spanwise boundary condition applied, we discuss a
 few simulations which have a slightly varied configurations.
 For this first we take the case of simulation of VALIANT HLD geometry which
 has the wind tunnel geometry and the supporting lateral sidewalls included
 in the simulation.
 Then we discuss the simulations where the spanwise length of the domain
 is reduced by a factor if 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

, and then a case with the including of only two rectangular plates to use
 reflecting boundary conditions in the spanwise boundaries as opposed to
 periodic conditions used in the standard simulations.
 All these cases are shown to develop the spanwise cells for the time-averaged
 spanwise velocity field.

 parameters maintained same as that of the standard simulation in the free
 flow configuration discussed in the previous chapter.

As such, simulation of the VALIANT experimental setup has the following
 difference from the free flow simulation setup that is used as standard
 in this thesis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The spanwise length of the domain is 1 chord length, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3m$
\end_inset

 whereas in the free flow simulations, spanwise length is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2m$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Spanwise boundary conditions are set to wall boundaries with no slip at
 the wall surface and uses a wall model for the cells adjacent to the wall
 surface.
 In free flow simulation, periodic conditions are applied on spanwise boundaries
 to mimic an infinite spanwise domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The experimental setup has a nozzle geometry which creates an unsteady shear
 layer around the airfoil where as the free flow simulations have only the
 airfoil surface as a solid generating turbulence and vorticity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the case of simulation with the inclusion of tunnel geometry, the coordinate
s axis are chosen differently since the flow is now aligned such that the
 downstream axis is along the X-coordinate axis and the spanwise direction
 is along the Y-coordinate axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time-averaged mean flow fields are computed from the simulation data
 by averaging over 5 chord pass times, same as the standard procedure.
 The spanwise velocity inside the cove are then inspected along spanwise
 oriented planes.
 Different planes are shown in Fig.

.
 As can be noted, the cell formation due to the previously mentioned curvature
 instability is notable in the spanwise velocity distribution near the central
 plane away from the lateral walls.
 However, closer to the walls, the velocity field is more strongly modulated
 with stronger amplitudes than near the center planes.
 Such effects were also noted in the presence of the backward facing steps
 where lateral side walls generate strong three dimensionality for flow
 adjacent to the walls 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However these can be thought to be a separate phenomena since the lateral
 walls of the airfoil also generate additional dynamics due to the problem
 of corner separation for the turbulent boundary layer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cells near the center plane appear to have the same properties as those
 formed in the free flow simulation.
 The modulation are largely attached to the shear layer, and as the shear
 layer developed downstream, the cells inside the recirculation region tend
 to remain attached to the shear layer.
 A separate arrangement of cells with phase inversion is seen to then occupy
 in the interior of the cove nearer to the curved inner wall of the slat.
 This new arrangement then develops stronger towards the slat gap but is
 noticeably more distorted due to the end wall effects.
 The nodal planes leading to converging and diverging planes are noticeable
 which suggests that the pulsating mechanism related to the low frequency
 broad band peak can be present.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extend of the effect of lateral walls into the interior of the cavity
 in spanwise direction is significant.
 Current simulation suggests that more than 
\begin_inset Formula $80\%$
\end_inset

 of the spanwise extend is affected by the distortion and the curvature
 related flow structure is limited to only 
\begin_inset Formula $20\%$
\end_inset

 of the length.
 This means that curvature related low frequency pulse is considerably weaker
 in the experimental spectra and hence is also not notable.
 It is hence possible that the experiment also has reduced effect of the
 spanwise modulation leading to a reduced modulation of the tonal frequencies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another factor worthy of mention is that in comparison with the VALIANT
 experiment which uses a spanwise length of 1 chord length, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3m$
\end_inset

 as the distance between the spanwise plates, the setup for a different
 experiment on the 30P30N HLD geometry by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KamliyaJawahar2021"

\end_inset

 used a spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5m$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of the chord to span ratio, VALIANT experiment kept 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{L_{s}}{C_{s}}=1$
\end_inset

, whereas in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "Jawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

's work, a ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{L_{s}}{C_{s}}=1.42$
\end_inset

 was kept.
 The latter also was designed at a Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=70000$
\end_inset

.
 The experiment was conducted at the wind tunnel facility at University
 of Bristol and lead to observation of the prominent low frequency hump
 in the spectra corresponding to the first Rossiter mode, and particularly
 with strong intermittency and stochastic character.
 From the influence of the lateral side wall plates that is shown to disrupt
 the spanwise mode formation due to centrifugal instability and the nature
 of its suspected low frequency oscillation, we conjecture that the strength
 of the low frequency hump in the noise spectra will be correlated with
 the availability of sufficient space between spanwise holding plates.
 This can also influence the strength of the tones and can be suspected
 to be the reason for the variation of strength for the alternating narrow
 bands peaks in their far-field observation.
 It is however the general wisdom that keeping the spanwise distance as
 high as possible would reduce the three dimensional effect of the side
 wall boundary layer thereby recovering the spanwise homogeneous 2D flow
 in the spanwise central plane.
 But counter-intuitively, this is only disrupting the development of the
 three dimensionality due to the centrifugal instability which has a significant
 modulation on the tonal characteristics, particularly for the first Rossiter
 mode.
 Further mode, the measurement of the turbulent intensity and wall pressure
 spectrum will also be misinformed in the case of insufficient spanwise
 margin in the experiment since the existence of a nodal plane at the spanwise
 central plane can lead to erroneous observation of either excessive or
 reduced turbulence intensity due to the converging or diverging motion
 of spanwise structures in the cove recirculation region.
 The spanwise modes and their possible oscillations hence provide a reasonable
 explanation to intrigue upon the quasi-periodic behavior of the first Rossiter
 tone in the study by

A simulation with a reduced span of one-half of the original length was
 also attempted.
 The result show that the flow development shows little difference in the
 larger two dimensional features of the flow in the mid-span plane.
 However, the three dimensionality of the cove flow and the formation of
 spanwise cells seems to be attenuated in this case.
 As shown in Fig.

, the spanwise cells are formed in the early part of the shear layer as
 expected from the full span simulation.
 However, for the region corresponding to the later part of the shear layer,
 the spanwise modulation seams to have weakened leading to more homogeneity
 in the flow and reduced spanwise velocity component.
 This induced homogeneity of the flow due to spanwise condition is well
 recognized in literature and have served as a criterion to determine the
 lower bound for the spanwise length of simulation domain for numerical
 studies

 have already studied the VALIANT geometry using different spanwise extent
 to demonstrate the same phenomena.
 For the current case, spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1m$
\end_inset

 is hence inferred as insufficient to reproduce the three dimensionality
 of the flow.
 This leads to the partial formation of the spanwise modulations in the
 early part of the shear layer due to strong curvature of the flow and a
 largely homogeneous spanwise distribution in the rest of the cove region.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partial presence of the spanwise cells in a reduced span simulation
 also hints at the fact that the spanwise boundary condition acts only so
 as to induce homogeneity.
 The persistent formation of cell structures in the region of early shear
 layer with strong curvature again suggest that the 3-dimensionality is
 predominantly a centrifugal effect.
 This centrifugal flow is primarily driven by the concave curvature of the
 inner wall of the slat cusp together with the redirection of the flow by
 the incoming ambient flow from upstream.
 Persistence of the spanwise modulation at this region while induced homogeneity
 in the downstream locations due to spanwise periodic condition in the simulatio
n suggest that the strength of centrifugal effect is higher in the region
 of early shear layer compared to other regions in the cove.

 Here the scaling of the slat chord, and hence the cavity depth, is also

The Reynolds number of the flow is also scaled by a factor of

 due to the scaling of characteristic length.
 However, the inlet velocity is maintained at 
\begin_inset Formula $50m/s$
\end_inset

 Here the magnitude of curvature is amplified by a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{2}$
\end_inset

 and hence higher the effect of centrifugal destabilization by the same
 factor.
 This qualitatively explain the necessity of a larger number of spanwise
 planes and thereby reduction of the spanwise wavelength.
 Nevertheless, the final selection of wavenumber is constrained by the fact
 that the spanwise boundaries have a periodic conditions there by necessitating
 a whole number of cells in the total span length.
 Since this phenomenon was only discovered during the exercise of this thesis,
 we did not conduct a parametric study to understand the variation of the
 span length, along with spanwise domain length.
 Such an investigation and also a model for the prediction of cell formation
 in the particular case of slat cove flow can be an interesting avenue for
 further investigation.

Analyzing the streamline curvature of the shear layer
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From analyzing the mean flow inside the cove region and drawing parallels
 from the literature on the spanwise modulation of curved flows in cases
 of flow past a backward facing step, open cavity flows, and lid-driven
 cavity flows, it is logical to assume that the three dimensionality in
 the cove is due to effect of streamline curvature in the shear layer and
 recirculation region.
 The curvature of the streamline in the shear layer can also lead the effect
 of `Görtler' like transition leading to the generation of counter-rotating
 small-scale streamwise structures.
 Both these effects are fundamental to the slat noise generation mechanism
 whose tonal characteristics are necessarily influenced by the coherence
 of the impinging spanwise coherent vortices.
 Hence, to understand the curvature effects more thoroughly and to quantitativel
y understand its implications on the shear layer development, we attempt
 to characterize the mean streamlines by utilizing the mean field recording
 available from the LBM simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean streamlines can be obtained from time-averaged velocity field by
 integrating the latter in time from any chosen source point.
 If a constant time stepping is chosen, and the mean 2-dimensional velocity
 as the gradient field, a Runge-Kutta integrator can then recover the streamline
s from a given mean velocity field.
 Here, since we assume that the flow features in the spanwise direction
 are primarily due to the streamline curvature in the 2D plane parallel
 to the flow, we use the streamwise and cross-flow component of the velocity
 field to study the streamline in their 2D plane, and omit the contribution
 of spanwise velocity component.
 For the Runge-Kutta integrator, we select the classical fourth order RK4
 formulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean flow data is obtained on the same cartesian grid as used in the
 simulation.
 However, this grid is not suitable to obtain a continuous streamline and
 hence the velocity field need to be interpolated in order to obtain the
 velocity value at a given query point for the RK integrator.
 For this interpolation we use the Clough-Tocher interpolation scheme provided
 with the scientific computing package SciPy.
 The interpolation scheme finds the three neighboring points of the query
 point and uses a piecewise interpolating Bezier polynomial with order of
 accuracy upto third degree.
 The streamline can thus be recovered for any selection of the source point
 in the flow field.
 However, to select a suitable point that would allow capturing the mean
 trajectory of the spanwise coherent vortices, we use the distribution of
 mean velocity magnitude on a straight line across the shear layer near
 the slat cusp as shown in Fig.

.
 The point at the bottom of the dip in velocity magnitude correspond to
 the point immediately downstream of the slat cusp and this point is selected
 as the source point for the streamline integrator.

The obtained streamline is then used to quantitatively analyze the streamline
 curvature.
 Geometrically, the local curvature of a streamline is defined as the rate
 of variation of a unit tangent vector direction with respect to the arc-length.
 This definition allows to calculate the Radius of curvature in different
 forms as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
R & =\left\Vert \frac{d\vec{T}}{ds}\right\Vert \\
 & =\left\Vert \frac{d}{ds}\left(\frac{dx}{ds}\hat{i}+\frac{dy}{ds}\hat{j}\right)\right\Vert \\
 & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial^{2}x}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\partial^{2}y}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}}\\
 & =\frac{\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}{\left[1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}\right]^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the Radius of Curvature, which is the reciprocal of the measure of curvature
, 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\frac{1}{R}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the path length.
 Here, since we obtained the coordinates of the points of the streamline
 path, we choose the formula 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
R & =\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial^{2}x}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\partial^{2}y}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $ds$
\end_inset

 is the differential arc length computed as the first order gradient of
 flow path-length obtained by cumulative sum of the individual Runge-Kutta
 integrated steps for the path-length.
 The numerical computation of the local Radius of Curvature as a function
 of the streamwise location on the shear layer for the standard geometry
 is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:localcurvature"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The calculation of gradients is particularly noisy for the calculation
 of the second order derivative along the streamline and hence an additional
 averaging is applied using a moving window of for the calculation of curvature.
 This averaging, with a window size of 100 points, reduces the numerical
 noise and delivers a smoother calculation in the early shear layer and
 also in the downstream where the mean velocity field is less converged
 due to the low frequency oscillations of the cove flow.
 For future calculation, using the second order gradient, we use only the
 smoothed version of the obtained quantities.

The measure of curvature is the inverse of the Radius of Curvature, R.
 The shear layer shape necessarily follows a path whose mean curvature is
 of the same order as that of the slat chord, thereby suggesting a mean
 radius of curvature around 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(C_{s}/2)=1/(0.039/2)=51.28m^{-1}$
\end_inset

 or lower.
 A lower bound for the curvature can be when the radius of curvature is
 close to the slat chord, and hence is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/C_{s}=1/0.039=25m^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and is consistent with Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:localcurvature"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The initial region of shear layer for the standard geometry follows this
 mean radius of curvature until the shear layer eventually straightens to
 generate a region of low curvature.
 For the selected geometry, there are two points where the curvature drops
 to low before it rises again towards the impingement location.
 At the impingement location, the mean streamline can have two trajectory,
 one into the recirculation zone, and the other towards the ejection through
 slat gap.
 The streamline which enters the recirculation zone is sharply curved as
 seen in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and is the region of highest curvature.
 The streamline which exits through the slat gap consequently have a smaller
 curvature than the other.
 This region, according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, also has a low velocity flow in the concave side of the curvature unlike
 the early part of the shear layer, making it a region of unstable curvature
 configuration.
 This region is hence susceptible to the centrifugal instability led modes
 which primarily has the effect of generating streamwise vortices.
 In the cove flow case, the spanwise eddies formed are well-known to degenerate
 in their spanwise coherence in this region and the flow consist majorly
 of streamwise oriented structures prior to the impingement at the slat
 trailing edge.

The effect of curvature on the flow is that it imposes an additional force
 arising due to the centrifugal effect.
 This effect is hence analogous to the effect of any additional force such
 as due to buoyancy force in stratified flows.

 studied the effect of curvature on the streamline in its analogy to stratified
 flow phenomenon in the large scale atmospheric flows and found that many
 numerical parameters are indeed useful for a quantitative comparison.
 To this end, we also compute the related parameters to investigate the
 streamline.

The deceleration on the streamline is far from ideal.
 The flow is first accelerated along a streamline in the initial region
 of the vortex shedding and as the streamline curvature decreases in the
 intermediate region, the flow is accelerated.
 But before the impingement near the wall, the stagnation causes a region
 of strong deceleration.
 This deceleration of the mean flow exerts the necessary pressure gradient
 required to counter act the centrifugal force generated by the curvature
 of the flow.
 However, when the angular momentum decreases radially across the streamlines,
 the centrifugal force can be in excess of the established pressure gradient.
 This imbalance is the fundamental cause for the centrifugal instability
 leading to the generation of vortex structures oriented along the streamwise
 direction.
 These vortices then allow exchange of momentum along the radial direction
 by the transport of fluid thereby balancing the deficit in the pressure
 gradient to counteract the centrifugal force.
 The rapid generation of streamwise vortices are also accelerated by the
 degeneration of spanwise coherent vortices which have already entrained
 a portion of the recirculating streamwise vortices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The location of maximum deceleration relative to the flow geometry is marked

.
 The position is not exactly on the slat trailing edge but slightly downstream,
 the exact location being dependent on the choice of streamline.
 Nevertheless, the marked position is the location of the maximum deceleration
 experienced by a fluid particle moving along the streamline and is hence
 the location of maximum momentum transfer.
 In view of the theory that impingement of vortices are responsible for
 the generation of acoustics waves that modulate the K-H shedding frequency
 at the cusp and thereby selecting the tonal noise frequency, this location
 must correspond to the length of the shear layer that predicts the tonal
 noise frequency.
 To understand this further we look at the actual velocity distribution
 along the streamline and compute the time of travel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time required for the spanwise eddy to reach the location of maximum

The total time is then obtained as sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{S}$
\end_inset

 and the acoustic propagation time from the location of impingement to the
 source point of the streamline.
 This calculation leads to total time of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.213ms$
\end_inset

 corresponding to a frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $824Hz$
\end_inset

.
 To use the tone prediction formula of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 which has the simplified form as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{n}=n\frac{U_{\infty}}{L_{a}}\cdot\frac{1}{\mathcal{M}+\frac{\alpha_{l}}{\kappa_{v}}}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the acoustic path length, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{l}$
\end_inset

 is the ratio of length of the shear layer to the acoustic path between
 the impingement location and the cusp and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{v}$
\end_inset

 is the ratio of vortex convection velocity of vortices along the shear
 layer to the free stream velocity.
 Here, the vortex convection velocity is not calculable from a mean flow
 solution and for experimentation we resort to the value obtained for the
 same case by Terracol et al., i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{v}=0.79$
\end_inset

.
 Based on the location of maximum deceleration, the acoustic path length
 is obtained as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{a}=0.0326m$
\end_inset

, and the vortex path length along the shear layer as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{v}=0.0387m$
\end_inset

, leading to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{l}=1.187$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting fundamental tone corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

, is then at 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}=928Hz$
\end_inset

 and the multiples being 
\begin_inset Formula $[1856,2784,3712,4640,\text{ and }5568]$

 Hz.
 These frequencies are higher than the experimental tone frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $[1771,2655,3540,4425,\text{ and }5310]$
\end_inset

, and hence suggest that the location of maximum deceleration is a location
 slightly too early than the actual location of the acoustic generation.
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

's formula is highly sensitive to the computation of the shear layer path
 length and hence the location of the acoustic generation lending high level
 of uncertainity in the tone calculation using this method.
 Moreover, for the same calculation, a correction of the convection velocity
 factor to 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{v}=0.75$
\end_inset

 can lead to a more accurate prediction of the frequencies suggesting in
 favour of the hypothesis that this location is representative of the acoustic
 source location.

 His analogy of the case of streamline curvature with the case of stratified
 flow under the effect of buoyancy led to the formulation of representative
 parameters.
 One of these, pertinent to interpretation of the slat shear layer, is the

 while studying the stability of curved free shear layer in the small curvature
 regime.
 The generation of vorticity in the streamwise direction, in their perspective,
 is an effect of the diffusion of the turbulent velocity perturbation into
 the streamwise direction led by the effect of the centrifugal force and
 hence arises from the requirement of inviscid stability.
 The flux Richardson number aids in quantifying the effect of this imposed
 vorticity transfer by taking into account effect of the centrifugal force
 acting on the flow and also the local vorticity thickness by incorporating
 the radial streamwise-velocity gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial n}$
\end_inset

.
 In this regard, we augment the existing perspective as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well understood from the literature that the streamline curvature
 along a shear layer can lead to additional instability arising from the
 centrifugal force.
 This leads to the generation of streamwise vortices across a wide range
 of Reynolds numbers.
 The effect of curvature is such that there is a generation of streamwise
 vorticity which is cumulative in the sense that this accumulation of streamwise
 vorticity happens as long as the flow traverses an unstable curvature,
 i.e.
 with a reduction of the angular momentum radially outward from the center
 of curvature.
 The cumulative effect of this curvature can be captured by the total transfer
 of momentum due to the additional centrifugal force in action, or as the
 work done by the same.
 The instantaneous momentum transfer effected by the centrifugal force while
 the fluid traverses a curved path 
\begin_inset Formula $ds$
\end_inset

 with a local radius of curvature 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, traversing with a streamwise velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, is equivalent to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dM_{c}=\frac{U^{2}}{R}\frac{ds}{U}=\frac{U}{R}ds
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is the velocity component along the streamline, and in the vectorial sense
 of the centrifugal force, the direction of this momentum transfer is invariant
 as the direction radially outward from the center of curvature.
 The resulting term 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{V}{R}$
\end_inset

 is hence the effective density of total momentum transfer due to the centrifuga
l force along the path length.
 Thus the curvature Richardson number of the form in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:curvatureRich"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 effectively capture the effect of the centrifugal force in its momentum
 transfer leading to the generation of streamwise vorticity.
 The same term is used in the curvature Richardson number together with
 the cross-stream velocity gradient, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}$
\end_inset

.
 In case that the shear layer has a strong velocity gradient such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}>>\frac{U}{R}$
\end_inset

, as in the early part of the slat shear layer, or in the case of a plane
 shear layer, the curvature Richardson number approaches zero.
 However, in the region where the shear layer weakens, and the curvature
 is finite such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}<<\frac{U}{R}$
\end_inset

, the curvature Richardson number will tend to saturate at 2.
 For the case of applying the linearized equations to study effects of a
 slightly curved free shear layers, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 used a Richardson number of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, for the case of slat shear layer, the curvatures are of the order
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{2}$
\end_inset

 and hence is expected to be highly non-linear in its dynamics with Richardson
 number near the saturation value of 2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The computation of curvature Richardson number requires to calculate the
 strain rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}$
\end_inset

.
 For this we obtain the normals of the streamline on each point of the streamlin
e using a constant cell size.
 An over-resolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.5\times10^{-5}m$
\end_inset

 is maintained to avoid numerical discrepancies.
 A subsample of the streamline normals along the length of the streamline
 is shown in Fig.

 in Fig.

\end_inset

 .
 As can be seen, the initial vorticity thickness near the slat cusp has
 an order of magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{4}$
\end_inset

 which reduces downstream due to the shear layer spreading.
 Streamwise locations after the streamline enters the recirculation is noisy
 again due to the low frequency oscillations of the cove requiring longer
 averaging time to be averaged out.

 The Richardson number can be seen to have a low value in the early shear
 layer due to the high value for the strainrate.
 As the shear layer spreads, the curvature Richardson number tends to increase,
 this suggesting the strong momentum transfer due to the centrifugal force.
 In the mid-region, the curvature reduces as the shear layer inverts its
 direction of the curvature towards the unstable configuration, and the
 Richardson number hence drops.
 Afterwards, the curvature Richardson number increases as the shear layer
 spreads due to growth of the spanwise eddies along with entertainment of
 streamwise vortices.
 The curvature Richardson number then tend to saturate towards 2 in the
 region immediately downstream of the location of maximum deceleration,
 owing to the large value of curvature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The case considered in the current chapter is the standard geometry with
 standard position of the slat with respect to the airfoil.
 This configuration showed strong presence of the broadband acoustic spectra
 and tonal noise owing to the fact that the spanwise coherence of the shed
 vortices from slat cusp is not fully disintegrated by the time of their
 travel towards the trailing edge.
 This means that the momentum transfer due to centrifugal force is rather
 weak in this particular case.
 This fact is reflected in the distribution of the curvature Richardson
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:localcurvaturerichardson"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, since its value is typically low in the region of the early shear layer.
 The flow is also stable towards centrifugal instability due to the stable
 configuration of increasing angular momentum along the radius of curvature.
 The curvature Richardson number rises to a strong value only near and downstrea
m of the location of maximum deceleration suggesting that the flow did not
 accrue largely the effect of the centrifugal force, as it would have been
 the case if the flow developed a larger curvature Richardson number further
 upstream of the impingement location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being said, we now define a non-dimensional quantity that allows us
 to compare the effect of curvature for any given geometry of the slat shear
 layer, based only on the shear layer shape and mean flow distribution.
 For this we use a cumulative integral of the Richardson number along the
 shear layer, which can be formally written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M^{*}(l)=\frac{\int_{0}^{l}Ri_{f}ds}{L_{v}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 is the length along the streamline through the shear layer, and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{v}$
\end_inset

 is the total path length of the vortices from slat cusp to the point of
 impingement.
 For the given standard case, the cumulative curvature Richardson number
 as a function of the shear layer path length is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cumulativecurvaturerichardson"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For the given case, the cumulative Richardson number is at a value approximatel
y 0.005 at the location of maximum deceleration.
 The accrual of Richardson number above this value sharply increases in
 the region downstream of location of maximum deceleration suggesting that
 the strong generation of the streamwise structures arising from the centrifugal
 effect is downstream of this location.
 This slower accrual of the curvature Richardson number leads to a higher
 spanwise coherence of the spanwise eddies responsible for exciting the
 Rossiter mechanism and hence delivers a strong resonance leading to a noisy
 operation.
 This distribution of the cumulative Richardson number will be compared
 for multiple cases with a variety of shear layer shapes in the upcoming
 chapters.

\begin_layout Section
The Acoustics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mechanism of slat noise is an interesting phenomena due to its complexity
 itself.
 An accelerated curved free shear layer convecting the spanwise coherent
 eddies leads to their periodic impingement at the trailing edge of the
 slat and generates acoustic waves.
 The resulting acoustics waves are then strongly scattered by the trailing
 edge geometry leading to their amplification.
 The waves traveling back into the slat cove reaches the slat cusp which
 induces a periodic pressure fluctuation for the early shear layer, thereby
 modulating its streamwise oscillations.
 This modulation leads to a synchronization of the vortex shedding with
 the incoming perturbation leading to periodic shedding of vortices.
 The feedback loop then naturally resonates at a frequency that corresponds
 to the total time lag for vortex travel towards the TE and the time for
 acoustic feedback.
 This mechanism commonly found in cavity flows are referred to as the Rossiter
 modes and were first suggested as the mechanism behind slat tones by

\begin_layout Subsection
Farfield acoustic signature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The acoustic waves are best identified in the pressure or density field
 of the flow.
 However, in the near-field of the turbulence, the fluctuating component
 of pressure can have both hydrodynamic and acoustic components which is
 non-trivial to separate.
 However, the emanating acoustic wave fronts can be segregated in the region
 outside the turbulent region.
 A variable better suited for the visualization of the acoustic field is
 the dilatation field.
 Dilatation being the divergence of the velocity field, is the instantaneous
 density fluctuation, and represent the local compressible fluctuation of
 the fluid.
 It has the canonical definition as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Theta=\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{D\rho}{Dt}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{D}{Dt}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}.\nabla$
\end_inset

 represents the material derivative.
 The dilatation field around the HLD as obtained from the unsteady simulation
 is shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Dilatation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The wave fronts emitted from the slat cove are identifiable from the dilatation
 field towards both the suction side and the pressure side, latter being
 towards the ground observer.
 The major acoustic source region can be identified as the slat cove and
 the trailing edge of the main-element.
 The trailing edge of this HLD, must be recalled, is an arbitrary shaped
 trailing edge obtained by numerical optimization procedure by minimizing
 the difference between flow solution in the slat cove between the flow
 cases of a geometry with and without the trailing edge flap.
 Hence the noise generation from the trailing edge is not attended in our
 study unless it is found to have interference with the slat cove acoustics.
 This is not yet found to be true and will hence not be discussed in this
 thesis.
 Nevertheless, the same can be noticed to have a contribution to the acoustic
 field in the downstream part of the flow.

The slat cove radiation can be noticed to have characteristic directivity.
 The radiation towards the pressure side is seen to radiate from the region
 close to the slat gap, and for the radiation to the suction side, the source
 appears to be located within the slat cove.
 There also exist a region with acoustic shadow in the upstream of the slat
 due to the fact that for radiation upstream on the pressure side, the slat
 geometry serves to block the radiation.
 For the field near the suction side of the main element, the strong vorticity
 leads to hydrodynamic fluctuations of the density field.
 The dilation field being the material derivative of the unsteady density
 involves the temporal derivative, and hence amplifies the high frequency
 temporal oscillations in the field.
 The dilatation field is hence typically dominated by the hydrodynamic fluctuati
ons of the small scale turbulence in regions near the walls and the slat
 cove.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dilation field also has few drawbacks when used to visualize the data
 on the Cartesian grid with refinement interfaces.
 This is due to the fact that at the refinement interface, the calculation
 of derivative introduced numerical errors, which are however not temporal
 fluctuations.
 Hence the errors does not necessarily amount to generation of spurious
 acoustics in the simulation but vitiates the acoustic field visualization.
 Such errors can be noted on the pressure side of the main element and below
 the trailing edge of the main element where the mesh refinement interfaces
 are present.
 An improvement in this visualization is hence possible by using an alternative
 definitions of the dilation field.
 For this, assuming that in the farfield, only linear acoustic perturbations
 are dominant, the material derivative can be reduced to the temporal derivative
, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{D\rho}{Dt}\approx\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the density rate is an analogous representation for the dilatation
 field, but one which does not involve a spatial derivative.
 The temporal derivative also allows a faster calculation due to the implicit
 removal of the mean density from the total density field available in the
 flow recording.
 A visualization of the density rate field is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DensityRate"

.
 Nevertheless, the acoustic field thus visualized shows majorly wavefronts
 which have an approximate wavelength of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0.007m$
\end_inset

.
 This corresponds to acoustics waves of frequency higher than 50kHz.
 It hence suggest that the wavefronts visible in this visualization are
 strongly vitiated by the high frequency numerical noise which are amplified
 by the temporal derivative.

To study the acoustic modes of particular frequency, the unsteady pressure

 For this we choose to apply the filter for the pressure field on a 2D plane
 recording around the slat cove region for frequencies corresponding to
 the broadband hump at the 885Hz, and the tonal peaks at 1771, 2655, and
 3540 Hz.
 The Fourier transform and corresponding inverse transform at single frequencies
 were done using the python package NumPy.

The filtered field corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

 has two dominant lobes near the impingement location as shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 This is the location of maximum curvature where the streamline curves into
 the recirculation region.
 The two lobes on the either side of the location of impingement has opposite
 polarity and are coupled in their dynamics.
 The node between the two lobes appear to have a stationary location unlike
 a traveling wave for other frequencies.
 This suggest that this mode is not generated by the impinging vortices
 convected by the shear layer, but rather by a feature of the flow dynamics
 that is local to the impingement location.
 This is hence reasoned to be the low frequency steady mode fluctuation,
 as part of the steady spanwise mode found in the mean velocity fields,
 driven by the effect of strong curvature of the streamlines.
 Moreover, the opposing polarity of the two lobes suggest that there exists
 a strong oscillating pressure gradient.
 This pressure gradient leads to oscillation of the impingement location
 of the shear layer leading to a closing and opening of the cavity, which
 is enclosed by the shear layer on one side and the curved slat wall on
 the other side.
 Such an effect drives the fluctuation of the larger hydrodynamic pressure
 mode inside the cavity and due to the amplitude of oscillation will influence
 the vortex shedding frequency leading to a selection of common oscillating
 frequency between them.
 This process can hence be suspected to largely influence the frequency
 selection of the resonance frequencies, in addition to the Rossiter mechanism.

 The tonal frequency reveal that they are traveling waves along the shear
 layer with the lowest frequency having the largest lobes.
 For higher frequencies, the lobes grow smaller, however traverses with
 a constant convection velocity of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $23m/s$
\end_inset

.
 These are hence attributed to the large scale spanwise coherent structures
 convected along the shear layer inducing their traveling pressure fields
 on to the flow.
 The impingement location instead of having lobes separated by the impingement
 location, have shapes aligned with the ejected streamline.
 These lobes are however present in pairs arranged along the cross flow
 direction suggesting that the mode of fluctuation induce motion of the
 ejected fluid normal to the slat trailing edge wall, and normal to the
 mean streamlines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The dynamics of acoustic waves can also be noted to be strongly coupled
 with large amplitude hydrodynamic oscillations.
 For all frequencies visualized, the acoustic fluctuations near the slat
 trailing edge is notably synchronized with pressure fluctuations of the
 impingement dynamics.
 The radiated wavefronts upstream of slat trailing edge outside the cove
 also have their center precisely at the slat trailing edge.
 For the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

, the center of radiation is more ambiguous due to the fact that the wavelength
 at this frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.38m$
\end_inset

, roughly one order of magnitude higher than the slat chord.
 Hence this tone, along with the other characteristics tones less than approxima
tely 
\begin_inset Formula $9kHz$
\end_inset

, cannot form a standing wave in the 2D plane of slat cove flow between
 the slat trailing edge and cusp.
 Consequently, the only standing wave possible in the low frequency range
 is the spanwise direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The tonal wavefronts for the higher frequencies are notably centered at
 the slat trailing edge with a directivity normal to the tangent of the
 upper wall.
 The trailing edge of the VALIANT geometry has a thickness of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.7mm$
\end_inset

 and is hence not exactly a pointed edge as in the case of the cusp.
 The directivity of the lobe agrees well with the observations in the literature
 that the tonal directivities follow dipole behavior, with the axis of the
 dipole normal to the slat wall at trailing edge.
 However, this is only an approximation since only the upper lobe at the
 trailing edge can radiate to the farfield and the lower lobe is partly
 reflected and partly shielded by the presence of the main element.

\begin_layout Enumerate
The hydrodynamic pressure in the slat cove for all tone frequencies of 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

 and above extracted a spatially growing wave along the shear layer.
 These waves represent the pressure fluctuation induced by the vorticity
 generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The dynamic visualization of impingement of these spatial waves on the trailing
 edge suggest that they are in-phase with the acoustic source for corresponding
 frequency near the trailing edge for the tones at 1771Hz and above.
 This re-validates the fact that impingement of vortices are responsible
 for the acoustic wave generation and subsequent Rossiter mechanism.
 Nevertheless, raw representations of Fourier components are not directly
 representative of the coherent structures but of the phase fluctuation
 induced by them as they are convected along the shear layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the first Rossiter mode at 885Hz, the wavelength measured for the cells
 from the visualization shows a wavenumber of 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx34$
\end_inset

 and suggest a phase velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx25m/s$
\end_inset

 while the free stream velocity is 
\begin_inset Formula $50m/s$
\end_inset

.
 The phase velocity however is not representative of the convection velocity
 since an actual coherent structure convected is best modelled with a wavepacket
 with a representative group velocity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The hydrodynamic oscillation at the trailing edge for 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

 shows persistent elongated lobes along the shedding direction from the
 TE.
 These lobes represent pressure fluctuations that drives the oscillation
 of vortex shedding from the slat trailing edge that is responsible for
 the flapping motion of the shear layer at the slat TE and periodic flushing
 of the vortices on to the suction surface of the main element.
 Moreover, this oscillation being captured at 885Hz suggest that there is
 a frequency coupling of this flapping motion and the first Rossiter mode.

The wall pressure probes used to record the unsteady pressure fields in
 the simulation are analyzed next.
 For this, the pressure field is sampled at a rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $180405Hz$
\end_inset

, allowing to obtain the spectra upto 
\begin_inset Formula $90kHz$
\end_inset

 by the Nyquist criteria.
 The probes are activated for the full length of the simulation to monitor
 convergence and only the part of signals after convergence are subjected
 to power spectral density calculation.
 The raw pressure signals from the probes are shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Probes_raw_pressure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and the region after convergence of the simulation is highlighted in red.
 For the power spectral density calculation using Welsch method, we select
 a total of 41000 steps and a window size of 8200 steps with an overlap
 of 50%.
 This leads to a total of 9 averaging windows and a linear trend line is
 used to remove the mean from for each window to obtain the fluctuating
 component of the pressure.
 The PSD is then obtained with a resolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $22Hz$
\end_inset

.
 The locations of the probe along the spanwise center plane and their correspond
ing wall pressure spectra are shown in Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

From analyzing the data, the recordings from probes on the attacking side
 of the slat shows strong similarity with the far-field acoustic spectra.
 Probes 1, 3, and 5, shows the the first main tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

 although with less sharpness than the second tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $2655Hz$
\end_inset

.
 The second and third tones are prominent and a steady decay for the higher
 frequencies are noted as expected from the characteristic slat noise.
 Due to absence of a developed boundary layer or incoming turbulence, this
 pressure field is the incident acoustic field recorded by the wall pressure
 sensors.
 The same behavior can also be noted for probes 14, 16, 19, and 20, moving
 progressively from the trailing edge to the cove region on the pressure
 side of the main element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For probes inside the slat cove, namely, Probe 6, 8, 10, and 11, the obtained
 spectra shows a progressive behavior.
 The spectra for Probe 6 which is close to the slat cusp shows the second
 tonal peak at 
\begin_inset Formula $2655Hz$
\end_inset

 as the dominant tone and the first tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

 is shadowed by the low frequency fluctuations arising from the behavior
 of cove motion.
 This drowning of the tonal oscillations increases progressively towards
 the slat cusp, and for Probe 11, the tones are completely dominated by
 steady noise from the impinging vortex structures.
 The overall low frequency noise below 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

 also increases obscuring the hump at this frequency corresponding to the
 first Rossiter mode.

The very low frequency oscillations inside the cove are suspected to be
 the result of the modes induced by centrifugal modes which are also accompanied
 by the spanwise cell formations.
 Hence to understand this feature, plots of the spectra along the spanwise
 direction is generated using data from spanwise replica of the probes.
 The positioning of these replicated probes with respect to the geometry
 is shown in Fig.

From inspection of data from Probe 6 and its replicates as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:probe6wallpressure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it can be noted that the spanwise modulations are replicated in the low
 frequency part of the spectra particularly above 
\begin_inset Formula $200Hz$
\end_inset

 and below 
\begin_inset Formula $1000Hz$
\end_inset

.
 The spectra in this region tends to have a stronger SPL for spanwise locations
 that correspond to pressure locations which are at the diverging plane
 of the spanwise velocity field.
 Probe 6 location being close to the slat cusp with spanwise modulation
 at low frequency verifies the hypothesis of spanwise nodal planes and further
 suggests that there are low frequency fluctuations particularly associated
 with such planes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For other probes, namely Probe 7 which is adjacent to Probe 6, but deeper
 into the cove from the slat cusp, the spanwise modulation in the wall pressure
 spectra becomes less pronounced.
 This is expected from the shape of the spanwise velocity contours which
 shows that the cells near the slat cusp region is close to the shear layer
 and also transition to the upper chain of cells as we move along the curved
 inner wall of the slat.
 The modulation again gather strength for Probe 8 and 9, also with a lowering
 of the low frequency contents.
 As we move further towards the impingement location with Probe 10 and 13,
 the low frequency contents again becomes dominant due to the possible contribut
ion from low frequency fluctuations associated with strongly curved flow
 at the impingement location.
 For Probe 13 very close to the impingement, the low frequency contents
 are strongly dominant and the spanwise modulation is seen to have influence
 for higher frequencies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the spanwise modulated behavior, the presence of the tones at
 
\begin_inset Formula $2655$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3450Hz$
\end_inset

 can be seen to be present irrespective of the spanwise location.
 The first tonal peak at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

 however seems to be more susceptible to the spanwise modulations particularly
 for Probes 8, 9, and 10.
 For the low frequency hump at 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

, the wall pressure spectra is not able to provide a clear identification,
 although for probes outside the cove, namely Probe 3, 5, and 19, this hump
 is distinctly identifiable.
 This, most probably than not, must be the effect of low frequency fluctuations
 of the cove.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initial reduction of the low frequency fluctuations from Probe 6, placed
 at the highly curved flow region near the cusp, to intermediate probes
 and then gaining strength towards the impingement location again with highly
 curved flow due to impingement suggest that these fluctuations could be
 result of modes driven by the centrifugal instability.
 Another possible reason can be that the concave wall geometry acts as as
 a reflecting surface that leads to partial focusing of the reflected pressure
 waves near such locations.
 Furthermore, from Probe 6 in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:probe6wallpressure"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, it is clear that the flow near the cusp has spanwise modulated pressure
 oscillations around 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the low frequency hump in the far-field acoustic spectra.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Now, from the presence of converging and diverging planes of spanwise velocity,
 it is possible that the fluid accumulates at the converging plane and has
 to be redistributed to the diverging planes by a dynamic mechanism.
 We hence how hypothesize that it is the periodic bursting of the early
 shear layer at the diverging planes that leads to this redistribution of
 fluid and in this process results in hydrodynamic pressure oscillation
 eventually leading the radiation of acoustic waves at this frequency.
 This mechanism therefore must be the most pronounced in the hot-wire measuremen
ts at the slat cusp if a spanwise investigation is enabled.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

We now proceed to inspect the numerical hot-wire probe data.

The hot-wire probe data allows to analyze single point time series recording
 of the flow velocity.
 The point recording captured from LBM simulation at select nodes are hence
 analogous to the hot-wire measurements in the experiments and are typically
 used to compare the experiment and simulations.
 Here we use the same to study spanwise variability of the flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various groups of probes are used to obtain the velocity fields near the
 cusp, near the slat trailing edge, and on few select locations on the main
 element wall.
 We intend to call these probe groups as files and their positions are shown
 in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 Among these we first analyze the file placed near the cusp across the early
 shear layer, capturing the variation of turbulent velocity field from outside
 of the cove flow to its interior.
 For this, first the mean velocity magnitude is plotted as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

 concurs with the mean inflow velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $50m/s$
\end_inset

, and the deceleration due to presence of the main-element outside the cove
 region.
 The mean recirculation velocity near the cusp is obtained as 
\begin_inset Formula $15m/s$
\end_inset

, which also concurs with Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:velocityacrossshearlayer"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The velocity magnitude profile is also largely spanwise invariant outside
 the cove and have a deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm5m/s$
\end_inset

 inside the recirculation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same profile for all velocity components are also shown.
 For the spanwise component shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, the region outside the cove region shows negligible variation whereas
 for the region inside the cove, the velocity switched signs with a peak
 amplitudes of 
\begin_inset Formula $7m/s$
\end_inset

, suggesting that the spanwise modulation is the main contributor to total
 velocity modulation along the span.
 The alternating averaged spanwise velocities correspond to the spanwise
 cells previously demonstrated in Fig.

 hot spots for a frequency of

 can be noticed.
 The hot spots appear strongest at spanwise location where the spanwise
 mean velocity switches sign from negative to positive suggesting that this
 location is a diverging plane and lower mean pressure is present.
 The periodic oscillations are interestingly absent in the locations of
 the converging planes where the fluid is removed from the spanwise motion
 potentially entrained by the shear layer.
 This suggest that redistribution mechanism arising from presence of nodal
 planes tend to develop a low frequency pulsating behavior with which the
 initial shear layer bursts periodically.
 This low frequency bursting is also consistent with the behavior identified
 by

\begin_layout Standard
Such a periodic bursting if present can affect the acoustics.
 Since the Rossiter mechanism is driven by the impingement of spanwise coherent
 vortices at the slat trailing edge, the retained spanwise coherence is
 a necessary factor for exciting a strong resonance.
 The periodic disruption of the spanwise coherence of the early vortices
 thereby affects the resulting acoustic tones through an amplitude modulation.
 Furthermore, for Probe 20, which is placed deeper into the cove inside
 the shear layer, the spectral content shows increased activity at the same
 frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $200Hz$
\end_inset

.
 Here the averaged spanwise velocity modulation is also with a higher amplitude
 approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $7m/s$

 including 
\begin_inset Formula $200Hz$

 The higher energy levels at

Additionally, the modulation of spanwise velocity biased towards the interior

The Rossiter mechanism is a dominantly 2D phenomena and a 3D aspect can
 potentially disrupt its efficiency.
 Thus a variation of the oscillation amplitude of the hydrodynamic field
 across the span suggest that the first Rossiter mode can be destructively
 affected.
 This is in line with the fact that the first mode has a lower power levels
 in the farfield spectra and is often not obvious in the experimental studies
 where low frequency contents are polluted by the apparatus noise

 Moreove, the experimental studies assume that the flow in slat cove is
 dominantly 2D and examines wall pressure and hot wire probes at the spanwise
 center plane.
 This location in a symmetric setting can be reasonable assumed to have
 a diverging or converging plane for the spanwise velocity leading to concentrat
ion, rarification, and periodic behavior of the recirculated small scale
 streamwise structures.
 This will lead to erroneous evaluation of the turbulence and its spectral
 parameters.
 On the other hand, had the probes be placed in a plane corresponding to
 the center of a spanwise cell, the evaluated parameters would have been
 different for the first tonal peak.

In this chapter, we summarized the numerical investigation and major findings
 specific to the VALIANT geometry HLD with standard positioning of the slat.
 The slat coordinates were [SGP: 0.079mm, SDA: 35.5 deg, SOL: 6.36mm] and an
 angle of attack at

 This angle of attack is the one that provides the best agreement for the

The objective of the study was to investigate the details of data generated
 using unsteady 3D LBM for the slat cove flow and to revisit existing knowledge
 of the dynamics and acoustic generation mechanisms.
 In line with this, the unsteady visualizations of the cove vortices using
 Q-criterion was obtained and the behavior of spanwise coherent structures
 and their conversion to small scale streamwise structures were investigated.
 Here the generation of streamwise structures were already identified in
 the literature to be generated due to the accelerated curved flow in the
 literature, also at lower Reynolds numbers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Detailed visualizations used in this study suggest that the vortices are
 generated from the outer periphery of the spanwise coherent structures
 and that a major fraction of the recirculated vortices are entrained and
 consumed by the spanwise coherent vortices from the early development of
 the shear layer.
 A region of relative sparsity of the streamwise structures on the mid-length
 of the shear layer where the curvature of the shear layer is minimal is
 also noticed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On inspecting the mean flow contours of the velocity and pressure fields
 in the cove, the 2D flow components largely agreed with the existing knowledge
 of slat cove dynamics.
 However, the distributions of spanwise velocity rendered strong spanwise
 modulations which called into question the veracity of a spanwise homogeneous
 flow typically assumed for the configuration in both experiments and numerical
 simulations.
 The spanwise velocity modulation with amplitude upto more than 10% of the
 mean stream velocity was observed in the simulation which used a spanwise
 domain length of more than 
\begin_inset Formula $5C_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.66C,$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the slat chord length and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is the stowed chord of the full HLD.
 To establish that the modulation is not an artifact of the simulation due
 to application of the periodic boundary condition, a simulation of the
 original wind tunnel geometry along with the lateral supporting plates
 were used.
 Here, the flow around the HLD was typically expected to be spanwise homogeneous
 in the region which is free from the influence of the wall in the experiment.
 But counter-intuitively this region was found to have a length of 0.2
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 where the same spanwise modulated spanwise velocity cells were noticed.
 However, the presence of spanwise modulations were also strongly disrupted
 by the presence of wall related turbulence for the rest of the span.
 Hence it is inferred that the presence of spanwise modulations is not a
 numerical artifact of the simulation but an effect of the centrifugal force
 due to the recirculating motion in the cove.
 To further the argument, two other simulations, one with a reduced span
 length by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

 and another with a subsized geometry with the chord scaled by a factor
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{3}$
\end_inset

 is also presented.
 Both the cases are also shown to retain the spanwise cell formation with
 the latter having a higher spanwise wave number for the modulations demonstrati
ng that the feature responds to the geometrical conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spanwise behavior of the flow was then attributed to presence of centrifugal
 instability leading to steady spanwise modes, particularly demonstrated
 in the works of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for rectangular cavity flow, and also analogous to that demonstrated for
 flow past a backward facing step by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The spanwise modulation was also shown to exist in moderate Reynolds number
 flows for lid-driven rectangular cavity flow by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Albensoeder2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The effect is hence reasonably assumed to be the result of centrifugal
 effects of flow with a curved streamline and is identified as a new fundamental
 fluid dynamic feature of the cove motion, which was not identified previously
 in the literature due to both an erroneous assumption of spanwise homogeneity
 and the very low frequency oscillations induced by its dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On further investigation of the mean flow distributions, it was inferred
 that the spanwise modulation of velocity leads to generation of converging
 and diverging 2D planes.
 The planes where, while moving along the positive spanwise direction, switches
 the spanwise velocity sign from negative to positive are the diverging
 planes acting as a source of the fluid for spanwise flow, and vice-versa
 are the converging planes acting as the sink.
 Such a configuration was found to distort the pressure field in the cove
 such that the low pressure center of recirculation (time-averaged) generated
 due the centrifugal effect is not spanwise homogeneous, but deflected towards
 the shear layer at the location of the diverging nodal planes.
 This lead us to conjecture that a full picture of the low frequency slat
 cove dynamics as the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The highly curved shear layer and the curved streamline of the recirculation
 enables saturation of spanwise modes associated with the centrifugal instabilit
y in recirculation region.
 This generated planes of convergence and divergence of the fluid mass in
 the spanwise direction.
 The fluid mass hence must be redistributed from the converging planes to
 the diverging planes to maintain mass continuity in the spanwise flow.
 However, in the peculiar configuration of a cavity flow bounded by a shear
 layer on one side, the velocity of flow outside the shear layer which entrains
 the fluid from the recirculation is at a higher velocity than the inner
 recirculation which plays the role of redistributing the fluid back to
 the diverging planes.
 Due to this difference of flow rates, the entertainment and removal of
 fluid mass is faster at converging planes and redistribution is slower
 in diverging planes leading to an imbalance of the mass continuity.
 This imbalance saturates periodically leading to a local bursting of the
 shear layer at the location of diverging planes, enabling mass transfer
 across the shear layer and leading to generation of streamwise oriented
 vortices in the process.
 The bursting hence periodically and locally disrupts the spanwise homogeneity
 of early shear layer in terms of spanwise vorticity and hence the spanwise
 coherence of the 2D K-H vortices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Rossiter mechanism selects the frequencies based on the number of vortices
 that are shed which upon impingement are able to close the aeroacoustic
 loop.
 This means that if there is a periodic disruption of spanwise coherence,
 select Rossiter peaks would be affected depending on the frequency of the
 modulating oscillation, while the vortex shedding at other frequency multiples
 can remain intact.
 One direct evidence of such a periodic disruption of spanwise coherence
 is that the acoustic waves formed by impinging vortices which drives the
 Rossiter mechanism will an amplitude modulated in time.
 A low frequency fluctuation of the spanwise coherence will hence result
 in the amplitude modulation of the Rossiter modes which is an evident phenomena
 is slat noise, though unexplained.
 The first broadband hump which corresponds to the first Rossiter tone is
 significantly lower in the sound pressure level compared to the second
 tone, and is not evident in the VALIANT experiment against installation
 noise.
 This peak also shows intermittent behavior according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for measurements in the wall pressure measurements.
 A further investigation of the farfield spectra observed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jawahar2021"

\end_inset

 shows that the low frequency broadband humps shows two symmetric shoulders
 on its sides, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, within a frequency range of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta St_{s}=0.12$
\end_inset

 on both side of its central frequency.
 We here theorize that this appearance of shoulders for the broadband low
 frequency hump is the result of the first Rossiter mode (corresponding
 to the BB hump) being amplitude modulated.
 The effect of amplitude modulation of a signal leading to development of
 additional symmetric peaks in the spectral domain corresponding to frequencies
 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{peaks}=F_{c}\pm F_{s}$
\end_inset

 around the carrier frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{c}$
\end_inset

 by the modulating signal frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{s}$
\end_inset

 is a canonical phenomena in signal processing.
 The case hence provides one qualitative evidence for modulation of the
 Rossiter mode but the fluctuations due to formation of spanwise modes.
 Correspondingly, an estimation of the Strouhal number for the 
\begin_inset Formula $200Hz$
\end_inset

 for our geometry yields a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta St_{s}=0.16$

Here the Strouhal numbers for the Rossiter tones are dependent on the shear
 layer path length.
 Following the hypothesis that the low frequency oscillation is due to the
 effect of mass flow disparity, the Strouhal number for the low frequency
 oscillation is not necessarily linked to the shear layer path length but
 related to the difference of velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta U$
\end_inset

 between the inner cove and the free stream and also to the length of spanwise
 cells 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 More formally, if the frequency of the cove bursting is 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B},$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B}\propto\Delta U$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B}\propto\frac{1}{\lambda_{s}}$
\end_inset

 , then the Strouhal number can be 
\begin_inset Formula $St_{B}\propto\frac{\Delta U}{\lambda_{s}}\times\frac{C_{s}}{U_{\infty}}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the spanwise cell wavelength is proportional to the slat chord
 as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula $St_{B}$

 would reduce to

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the velocity of recirculation.
 Hence Strouhal number for the bursting phenomena can be reasonably assumed
 to be dependent only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta U$
\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless a more rigorous approach on extracting a model for this Strouhal
 number requires knowledge of the dependence spanwise cell size based on
 the slat chord, and is beyond the objectives of this thesis.

Furthermore, from the inspection of data recorded from the high fidelity
 simulation, the vortex visualization enables to identify the cove bursting.
 For this, we increase the Q-criterion value used to obtain the iso-contours
 to obtain a smooth cover of the region of initial shear layer such that
 a bursting of this spanwise coherent isocontour, itself arising from the
 spanwise vorticity of the early shear layer, can be identified.
 Snapshots of the flow separated in time by a time interval of

 It can be noticed that the spanwise coherence of the shear layer is burst
 in a quick burst of streamwise vorticity formation which is then convected
 along the shear layer.
 The generated vortices also gain a spanwise velocity corresponding to the
 position of the bursting, i.e.
 the vortices from the bursting are carried by the positive of negative
 spanwise velocity depending on the proximity of such vortices to the negative
 or positive velocity cells in the initial stage.
 This suggests that the position of the bursting is only approximately static
 in the very early shear layer, and the towards the impingement location,
 the location of vortices from the bursting can be highly chaotic.
 This is only of significance if there is a sufficient difference of characteris
tic between the region of vortices from bursting and the slurry of streamwise
 vortices already present towards the impingement location.
 Nevertheless, the Rossiter mechanism is excited by the residual spanwise
 coherent vortex core of the shed vortices that is retained after the effect
 of vorticity transfer from spanwise to streamwise directions during the
 traversal along the curved shear layer, and hence in the region where the
 coherence is disrupted at the point of generation, the residual spanwise
 coherence would be lower momentarily, leading to modulation of the Rossiter
 mechanism.
 Hence, we believe that the unsteadiness of bursting location will contribute
 to the stochasticity observed for the Rossiter modes.

In conclusion, it must be stated that the spanwise modulation of the spanwise
 velocity present in the slat cove have a non-trivial impact on both the
 cove vortex dynamics and their acoustic signature.
 The problem of spanwise mode generation itself is sparingly attended in
 the fluid dynamics literature although the same has been noted, intrigued
 on, and partially characterized in the works including that of

 noticed in the recent exhaustive review of cavity flows by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 A further investigation of these phenomena is an open road for future research
 and can be undertaken by fundamental analysis of the behavior of the Navier-Sto
kes equation under the effect of strong curvature of of a shear layer which
 bounds a region of recirculation.
 For its implications for slat noise, it is clear from this demonstration
 that experimental investigations which use 2D PIV and hotwire measurements
 at the spanwise center-plane will not be able to capture the spanwise mode
 formations.
 This explains why the stochasticity of slat Rossiter tones remained elusive
 of a reasonable explanation, and the discrepancies related to the tone
 frequency calculations and amplitude calculations from explanation based
 on Rossiter mechanism alone.
