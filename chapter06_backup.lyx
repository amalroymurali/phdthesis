\begin_layout Chapter
Cove Vortex Dynamics in light of parametric LBM simulation dataset
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayesian framework together with ProLB and FWH modules explained in
 the previous chapter enables a computational investigation of the slat
 noise phenomena with unprecedented detail.
 The Bayesian Active Learning method is a numerical twin for an automated
 explorer who samples simulations based on the uncertainity of the noise
 surrogate model within any selected domain.
 The special application to aeroacoustics that we designed in this work
 approximates the acoustic data in the form of far-field spectra as a function
 of the position of slat with respect to the main element.
 A spectra is thus predicted by the model for any slat position along with
 a measure of its own epistemic uncertainity.
 A stochastic Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm then ensure that the
 model's exploration is always pinned to the most noisy case and hence collects
 data which are relevant to the noise characteristics.
 While this framework paves way to an optimal and automated aeroacoustic
 design optimization, in our current activity, we also enable data recording
 such that the phenomenology of cove dynamics can be investigated.
 This chapter is dedicated to this exploration of the dataset, with the
 ambition to manually elaborate on the the newly found cove dynamics.
 For this we focus particularly on the spanwise modulations of spanwise
 component of velocity, their periodic bursting behaviors at diverging planes,
 and how they affect the slat noise characteristics, and deploy comparative
 analysis across various cases based on slat positioning of the standard
 geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As pilot investigation to the same, we used the case of standard positioning
 of the slat in Chapter 3 to demonstrate that the spanwise modulations,
 that are newly found in the cove flow, suggests that the recirculation
 bubble has a non-homogeneous distribution of both time-averaged velocity
 and pressure along the spanwise direction.
 These modulations are also shown to be attached to the curved shear layer
 during its early spatial development although the whole volume of the cove
 remains modulated by phase-inverted arrangement of these cells.
 The presence of periodic inversion of spanwise velocity along the span
 also necessitates a mechanism that allows the stability of the converging
 and diverging planes which acts as sources and sinks for the spanwise flow.
 Here, the streamwise oriented small-scale recirculating structures are
 entrained by the shear layer and the recirculation resupplies them back
 into the cove.
 However, in view of the 1-Dimensional spanwise dynamics, the velocity with
 which the shear layer entrains the structures from a spanwise converging
 plane is approximately the free stream velocity outside shear layer, but
 the velocity responsible for replenishment of the diverging planes is the
 velocity of recirculation.
 The former is higher than the latter, the difference being quantitatively
 captured by the velocity ratio, and hence a mass and pressure deficit develops
 in the diverging planes of spanwise velocity.
 We theorized in the previous chapter that this leads to the low frequency
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bursting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the cove at the diverging planes and demonstrated that this frequency
 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $St\approx0.12$
\end_inset

.
 
\color black
The exact variation of Strouhal number however is postulated only to depend
 on velocity ratio between the free-stream and the recirculation based on
 the theory that the spanwise wave numbers are determined by centrifugal
 instability, and hence proportional to cavity depth, making the Strouhal
 number, more probably than not, independent of the characteristic length
 scale.
 This is only the case when the slat position is standard without additional
 deformation of the shear layer by variation of the slat position with respect
 to main element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the velocity ratio is not only difficult to measure precisely but
 also depends on the nuances in the shear layer shape.
 The average velocity inside the cove is determined by the position of the
 impingement location of the shear layer near the slat trailing edge, which
 in turn determine the massflow fraction that is being recirculated.
 Since this location have oscillatory motion, obtaining the time-averaged
 velocity ratio becomes case sensitive.
 In a simulation, the numerical accuracy of recirculation velocity also
 becomes dependent on the fidelity with which the shear layer development
 is captured.
 At larger scales, the effect of ambient free stream velocity and cavity
 shapes between slat and the main element also have non-trivial contributions.
 These factors hence need to be studied case by case to obtain a better
 understanding of the bursting phenomena and since our dataset is made based
 on stochastic sampling, a large variety of shear layer shapes are available
 enabling a comparative analysis.
 This will be one objective of the discussion in this chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the dynamics of the flow, implications of spanwise modes on acoustics
 arise not from the spatial modes themselves but from the above mentioned
 periodic bursting.
 The spanwise coherence of impinging vortex is the first necessary condition
 for aeroacoustic resonance to occur since the Rossiter mechanism is a largely
 2D phenomenon with the strength of resonance decreasing progressively with
 spanwise coherence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "HamiltonSmith2024,Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Hence, if the spanwise coherence is broken periodically at a frequency
 lower than the first Rossiter tone, the strength of resonance will also
 be modulated, which means that the acoustic tones are not sourced by ideally
 periodic fluctuations but are amplitude modulated by the bursting frequency.
 Such an amplitude modulation can be detected in the spectral domain as
 appearance of side bands which we conjecture as the reason for the first
 Rossiter tone to appear broadband due to contribution from sideband frequencies.
 This is however observable only if the span to chord ratio of the simulation
 is sufficiently large such that the centrifugally driven spanwise mode
 oscillations are prominent, as in the case of experiment by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KamliyaJawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The same effect will also vitiate the periodicity of the noise source characeri
stics rendering them as intermittent or quasi-periodic if analyzed close
 to the diverging planes.
 This is promptly underlined in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KamliyaJawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 which sheds light on the intermittency associated with the first Rossiter
 tone.
 Here it must be emphasized that the experimental investigations which selects
 the spanwise mid-plane to place the wall pressure and hot-wire probes may
 or may not be at the center of a diverging plane depending of the development
 of the cells.
 Hence, the studied characteristics will inevitably tend to diverge between
 the experimental observations from different wind tunnel cases in view
 of periodicity.
 The turbulence ejection that accompanies the bursting phenomena will also
 appear to induce intermittency in the turbulence characteristics in the
 slat gap since the periodicity of bursting is robust only in the very early
 shear layer near the slat cusp and generating vorticity from each event
 is then convected along with the rest of turbulence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important aspect of the cove dynamics which is related to slat acoustics
 is the vorticity transfer from 2D spanwise coherent structures in early
 shear layer to the smaller scale streamwise structures towards the slat
 gap.
 It is clear that the spanwise coherent vortex structures are responsible
 for driving the aeroacoustic resonance.
 However, this spanwise vorticity is not fully preserved as the shear layer
 develops towards the impingement location.
 The streamwise vortex structures from the recirculation interacts with
 the shear layer from the early development near the cusp and intertwines
 with spanwise structures to form a ladder structure.
 Towards impingement, the spanwise vorticity is thus largely converted to
 streamwise vorticity, the latter being a less efficient source of noise,
 both by driving an aeroacoustic loop or by trailing edge scattering.
 Extrapolating this scenario, we put forward the case that if the vorticity
 conversion effect is strong enough such that the reminiscent spanwise coherent
 vortex core that impinges the upper slat wall is weaker than that required
 to excite a resonance, the Rossiter tones can disappear.
 In between the extreme cases, it should also be possible to obtain a progressiv
e suppression of the tones thereby obtaining a model for the strength of
 the tones together with already available frequency prediction using Rossiter
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More importantly, and apart from this vortex dynamics which are clearly
 notable in the visualizations of simulation data, we also conjectured in
 this work that the fundamental driver of vorticity conversion to streamwise
 direction is not the interference by the entrainment of streamwise recirculatin
g vorticity but is an effect of the shear layer curvature.
 In this direction, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wang2023"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 previously showed that Görtler-like instability of the shear layer due
 to strong unstable curvature near the trailing edge can occur in case of
 low Reynolds numbers where the spanwise vortex shedding is weak.
 Early works of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bradshaw1969,bradshaw1973effects"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and more recently 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, have shown that a curved shear layer is linearly unstable due to the effect
 of curvature and can develop streamwise oriented vorticity by developing
 spanwise instability modes.
 Bradshaw drew the conclusion that the case of a centrifugal force acting
 on a streamline is analogous to the Their studies both suggest that a formulati
on of the curvature Richardson number can quantitatively capture the transfer
 of vorticity between streamwise and spanwise directions, if the flow is
 within linear approximations.
 Nevertheless, in contrast, the length scales and flow magnitudes in the
 slat flow case suggests that the curvature effects in cove dynamics should
 be strongly non-linear and hence the interactions cannot be accurately
 captured using a simplified formulation of the Richardson number.
 In how much the curvature Richardson number, or a cumulative history of
 the same along the shear layer path, can represent the relative strength
 of tones is thus the second objective of discussions in this chapter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For structuring the discussions we utilize the first section to explain
 the dataset and its organization to enable any future investigators.
 In Section 2 we discuss the mean flow fields from the dataset to understand
 the different flow cases and to identify a few particular cases for a more
 detailed analysis.
 In Section 3, the acoustic predictions for each of the cases are documented
 to understand how the far-field noise can be related to the mean flow fields.
 In Section 4, we extract the shear layer shape from the mean flow for each
 of the cases available using methods explained in Chapter 4.
 In Section 5, 6, and 7, we choose 4 interesting cases and discuss the newly
 observed spanwise modes and their low frequency oscillations to establish
 the relations between the shear layer shapes and these behaviors.
 In Section 8, we include a few additional cases that we simulated during
 our investigation to improve the argument that the effect of the shear
 layer shape and the curvature Richardson number can explain the the variability
 of the tonal nature of slat noise.
 In Section 9, we also attempt to provide an estimation of the Strouhal
 number based on the details available from the datasets.

Data Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enable reuse and further extension, the data is first organized into
 cases representing different slat positions.
 For each case, the data used to generate the LBM simulation case files
 are available in the pre-processsing folder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

preproc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the connected scripts for editing the files according to case specific
 needs being archived in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

templates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folder.
 For the template based setup that we used, the files are largely the same
 for different cases except for the slat geometry file which is updated
 with the coordinate translation necessary according to the slat coordinates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each case we follow then conventions as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Case names and regular expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each test case for slat position coordinate is represented by a regular
 expression (regex).
 The four slat coordinates, namely Angle of Attack (AOA), Slat Deflection
 Angle (SDA), Slat Gap (SGP), and Slat Overlap (SOL), together with the
 coordinate values are used to form the case specific regex.
 Characters `p' and `n' are prepended to the value to denote positive and
 negative signs respectively.
 A python3 snippet used to generate the regex, given the four coordinate
 values are given below.

\begin_layout Subsection
Folder structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the simulation case data is stored in a folder named using the above-men
tioned regex.
 Within each case folder, the data is archived for each step during generation
 of the simulation case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pre-processing - The folder `preproc' contains, for each of the simulated
 case, files generated using preprocessing.
 It includes the case geometries in which the slat.stl file from the master
 folder is transformed to obtain the file with case specific positioning,
 the probe coordinates transformed according to case requirement, and the
 FWH surface files.
 The data in this folder are then used to generate the LBPre case file using
 LBPre scripting features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Results - The folder `results' contains, for each of the simulated case,
 the data files generated by ProLB solver.
 The result files formatting are consistent across cases and contains primarily
 the following:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Mean flow recording - MeanQuantities.xmf and corresponding .h5 data file:
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The flow recordings are generated for the full domain of simulation and
 are recorded at full resolution of the mesh.
 Temporal averaging corresponds to 5 chord pass times towards the final
 end of the simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
FWH surface recordings - FWH_PermeableSurface_Recording_outsurf.xmf and correspon
ding .h5 data file:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The surface recordings are for velocity, pressure, and density data.
 Sampling rate is chosen according to requirements for the spectral resolution.
 The standard recording frequency is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $180405Hz$
\end_inset

, and has a total of 49200 times steps enabling 6 averaging bins, with 8200
 steps for each bin for the Welch method for PSD calculation.
 The resulting spectra can hence be obtained at a resolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $44Hz$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Q-criterion and Vorticity - UnsteadyCoveRecordingRes1Set#_grad.xmf and correspond
ing .h5 data file:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Unsteady data for Q-Criterion and Vorticity vectors in the slat cove region
 are recorded for visualizing the cove vortex behavior.
 The sampling rate is kept lower than FWH surface recording to save storage
 space and its sampling at 
\begin_inset Formula $22550Hz$
\end_inset

 is found sufficient for unsteady visualizations of the cove vortex evolution.
 A total spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.016m$
\end_inset

 are recorded around the span-center plane from a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2m$
\end_inset

 of spanwise length of the simulation.
 The recordings are saved in 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 sets along the spanwise length to enable faster post-processing also.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Post-processing - The folder `postproc' contains, for each of the simulated
 case, data files related to post-processing of the data.
 The post-processed data primarily has visualizations for the mean flow
 recordings, vorticity, and wall pressure coefficients.
 A slice of the mean recording in the cove region at center-span plane is
 also available as MeanData.csv.
 This recording is used for obtaining streamlines and the shear layer shape.

 The mean velocity fields at spanwise center-plane averaged over

 The procedure for obtaining the streamline using a Runge-Kutta integration

.
 It is to be noted in particular that the mean fields are not averaged along
 the spanwise direction.
 This is due to the fact that the simulations were designed without prior
 knowledge of the spanwise modulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the collection of shear layer shapes, the first observation is the
 sensitivity of shear layer shapes to the position of the slat with respect
 to the main element.
 Clearly the shear layer shape is influenced by all three coordinates of
 the slat simultaneously, but the slat gap majorly serves to determine the
 peak velocity of the ejection and the slat overlap determine the shape
 of the shear layer while the slat deflection angle indirectly determine
 orientation of the slat cusp with respect to the incoming flow and hence
 primarily determine the curvature of the initial shear layer.
 Regarding the shear layer, the slat overlap determine the horizontal proximity
 of the slat to the main element and when increased with respect to standard
 slat position, the shear layer is forced to have a low initial curvature
 and stronger curvature at mid-length as the flow is redirected to flow
 through the slat gap.
 As such, the slat overlap also significantly modifies the initial curvature
 of the shear layer and therefore the spanwise mode formations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particular case of high overlap is the Case 4.
 Here the flow at the cusp is largely aligned with the incoming flow along
 the outer wall of the slat cusp and is not immediately redirected as for
 the standard case.
 Instead the curvature is minimal in the initial region with a strong curvature
 appearing in the mid-trajectory and closer to the main element.
 In Case 4, the slat gap is also particularly reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $4mm$
\end_inset

 which reduces the ejected flow velocity to 
\begin_inset Formula $60m/s$
\end_inset

 which is a case of severe chocking flow when compared to the standard geometry
 which has an ejection speed close to 
\begin_inset Formula $110m/s$
\end_inset

.
 This reduction of speed leads this case to have a strong deviation from
 the standard noise profile, both for the broadband levels and the Rossiter
 tones.
 This case is also particular due to the fact that impingement points is
 still close to the slat trailing edge thereby avoiding a strong interaction
 of the shed vortices with the high turbulence region near impingement before
 approaching the trailing edge.
 Have the impingement be located deeper into the cove, the impinging vortices
 would have undergone a stronger disintegration leading to a complete attenuatio
n of the broadband and tonal noise.
 In the same direction, Case 11 can be noted to have a less skewed shear
 layer shape with the impingement point closer to the trailing edge.
 Hence the latter can be expected to have a slightly improved source efficiency
 for both broadband and tonal components.
 An even further improvement on the same is Case 19, which despite having
 a reduced initial curvature has a more evenly distributed curvature with
 the impingement point close to the slat trailing edge.
 As will be shown from the comparison of spectra, this significantly recovers
 the broadband and tonal characteristics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A case of high initial curvature of the mean shear layer is Case 5.
 This high curvature is due to the fact that the slat overlap is high together
 with a sufficient slat gap such that the flow is strongly redirected from
 the cusp towards the slat gap.
 Such high initial curvatures and high mean velocity along the shear layer
 leads to higher growth rates for the centrifugal related instability which
 will attenuate the noise.
 In addition to this effect, in this case the impingement point is deeper
 into the cove as compared to the standard noisy configuration, and hence
 the impinging vortices have a strong interaction with the highly turbulent
 region of impingement.
 Therefore the spanwise coherence is significantly reduced before the flow
 approaches the trailing edge.
 This case hence is expected to have a low efficiency for the tonal and
 broadband components.
 Similar cases are Case 8, 9, 12, 14, 27, 28, and 30, whose impingement
 location is too far from the trailing edge to enable the same as a strong
 noise source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cases with a strong characteristic broadband and tonal characteristics
 are those which are close to the standard geometry.
 The shear layer shapes for this noisy configuration is clearly identifiable
 from the dataset by qualitative judgment.
 The main characteristics include a moderately uniform distribution of the
 curvature together with an ejection velocity twice that of the free stream.
 In the dataset probed by the Bayesian model, the most noisy case is Case
 22.
 This case has the same angle of attack as the standard case.
 The difference of geometry in Case 22 is that the slat is moved further
 outward from the main element enabling a higher slat gap.
 The slat deflection angle is decreased in Case 22 thereby balancing the
 effect of increase of other two coordinates and renders a shedding of vortices
 which are convected along a uniformly curved path to the the slat trailing
 edge.
 The positioning of the impingement location is such that vortical structures
 have minimal interaction with the stagnated turbulent region of the impingement
 by being convected directly to the trailing edge but inevitably mean shear
 layer streamline from the cusp has incidence on the trailing edge wall.
 These characteristics renders Case 22 the most noisy in the dataset and
 hence is taken as the base case for comparative analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary, the effect of shear layer shape on acoustics is qualitatively
 deducible here.
 It can be noted that both broadband and tonal noise levels are proportional
 to the exit velocity with additional influence from the location of impingement.
 This complements the literature where a scaling law of the slat noise level
 was established with OASPL in the characteristic frequency range proportional
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{5}$
\end_inset

, where M is the free stream Mach number.
 The location of impingement however does not necessarily need to be stationary
 with respect to an increase in the free-stream velocity and neither does
 the maximum exit velocity at the slat gap since impingement location influence
 the both the recirculation flow rate and the exit flow rate.
 This explains why the canonical scaling laws based on free-stream parameters
 for slat-noise have high uncertainties.
 In addition, the location of impingement closest to the trailing edge are
 inevitably noisy despite the fact that the shear layer curvature is relatively
 high for some cases.
 Hence it can be safely assumed that the noise characteristics are primarily
 determined by the dynamics at the impingement location.
 The overall curvature profile also has an influence on the power levels
 due to reduced vorticity conversion and serves as a particular advantage
 for Case 22 making it the most noisy case.
 A more appropriate analysis and scaling laws for slat noise, in our proposition
, must therefore be based on the geometric parameters of the shear layer.
 These geometric parameters can then be related to the free-stream variables
 and the slat coordinate positions which would then reduce the uncertainity
 of their predictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To elaborate further, we must discuss the numerical calculations based on
 the mean shear layer.
 Before this we take a quick detour to discuss the details of the observed
 acoustic characteristics in the upcoming subsection for completeness.

 This hump is usually not noticeable in experimental studies since at frequencie
s close to and less than 800Hz, the noise from jet shear layer issued from
 the wall lips of the tunnel in the experiment and other installation noises
 are prominent.
 This noise floor is not present in the simulations of the airfoil in free-strea

One interesting observation from the spectra dataset is that our choice
 of spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{z}=0.2m$
\end_inset

 has an important implication for the simulation.
 For an acoustic wave of this wavelength the corresponding frequency is
 
\begin_inset Formula $1715Hz$
\end_inset

 and the fundamental of this tone is at 
\begin_inset Formula $1715/2=858Hz$
\end_inset

.
 The higher harmonics then follow the formula for harmonics as 
\begin_inset Formula $f=N\frac{2c}{L_{z}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the acoustic speed, and the set of frequencies corresponding to a stationary
 wave in the spanwise domain will be 
\begin_inset Formula $[858,1715,2574,3432,4290,\text{ and }5148]Hz$
\end_inset

.
 These frequencies are marked in all plots for far-field spectra in the
 dataset to show that as the slat position is varied with respect to the
 airfoil, the frequencies may or may not match with these spanwise characteristi
cs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Case }[7,15,16,17,19,20,26,29]$
\end_inset

 are examples in which the slat positioning leads to a different set of
 frequencies with the peaks maintaining the same amplitudes as for the standard
 case.
 This serves the argument that the spanwise domain size of the simulation,
 although possibly imposing similar characteristic frequencies, are not
 a reason for the existence of such tones.
 That being said, it is possible that most noisy configuration, Case 22,
 and the configuration in close proximity to the same in the slat coordinate
 system may tend to have a spurious numerical bias towards selection of
 frequencies depending of the spanwise length of simulation.
 Given that the same span simulations with varying slat positions renders
 a variety of frequency selections, this is only a remote possibility and
 not explored in this work.

\begin_layout Section
Vortex Dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slat cove vortices and their behavior is an intriguing phenomenon in view
 of their dynamics.
 As well-explained in the literature for slat noise, the primary vortices
 in the cove are those generated from the slat cusp due to the shearing
 of flow between inner cove flow and the incoming ambient.
 The velocity difference leads to 2D Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability and
 leads to formation of structures which are nearly homogeneous in the spanwise
 direction.
 The vortices then travel to the slat trailing edge as they are convected
 by the mean flow which itself is accelerated by its passage through the
 constricted slat gap.
 The resulting acceleration leads to breaking up of the spanwise coherent
 structures into streamwise structures as they travel past the slat trailing
 edge and thus the ejected flow majorly contain streamwise oriented counter
 rotating vortex strands.
 These strands then interact with each other to generate helical vortices
 as they are are flushed onto the suction side of the airfoil.
 A visualization by isolating the spanwise coherent vortices shed from the
 slat cusp and their transition behavior towards the trailing edge is shown
 in Fig.

Görtler vortices at the trailing edge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The behavior of cove vortices are hence interesting from a view of its fundament
al fluid mechanics.
 One interesting phenomena is the above-said transition of majorly spanwise
 vorticity in the early shear layer into streamwise vortices.
 One theory suggesting the generation of streamwise vortices is derived
 from an analogy related to Görtler vortices.
 In boundary layer flow past a concavely curved wall, the flow tends to
 develop streamwise oriented vortices as studied in detail by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Goertler1941"

\end_inset

 and later by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Saric1994"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 According to their analysis, the centrifugal force developed due to the
 curvature of the streamline is balanced by a pressure gradient normal to
 the streamline.
 The pressure gradient is responsible for redirecting the flow along the
 curved path and at higher curvatures when the centrifugal force is in excess,
 the pressure gradient developed will not be sufficient to redirect the
 flow resulting in an instability.
 In the unstable regime, the flow try to balance itself by generation of
 streamwise vorticity that aid in the transfer of momentum across this pressure
 gradient normal to the streamline.
 Moreover, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:gortler_vortices_schematic"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the angular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $rU$
\end_inset

 is 0 at both the center of curvature and at the wall since 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

 at the center of curvature and 
\begin_inset Formula $U=0$
\end_inset

 at the wall respectively.
 Hence there must exist a maxima for the angular velocity in the flow region
 and also a region where 
\begin_inset Formula $rU<0$
\end_inset

.
 This idea was used by Görtler to show that the solutions to corresponding
 disturbance equations are of the form of streamwise-oriented counter rotating
 vortices.

.
 In the trajectory of slat cove vortices, this transition is thus justified
 only near the trailing edge, where the flow is redirected away from the
 impingement location to be ejected out of the slat cove.
 At this location, the streamline curvature is such that high speed flow
 is on its concave side thus having a negative velocity gradient along the
 radius of curvature.
 Let aside the fact that the flow is strongly accelerated at the slat gap
 due to the nozzle effect of the cove geometry, the curvature effect is
 sufficient to generate streamwise vorticity.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 experimentally studied the effect of chord based Reynolds number on the
 cove vortex dynamics and suggested that the Görtler vortices are present
 even at low Reynolds numbers, 
\begin_inset Formula $Re\approx1.3\times10^{4}$
\end_inset

 when shedding of spanwise coherent vortices from the cusp are absent.
 At higher Reynolds numbers, the flow develops the spanwise coherent structures
 in the early shear layer and is convected through the region of unstable
 curvature near the trailing edge.
 These spanwise structures thus interacts with the streamwise vortices that
 are generated in-situ and also those which are convected from the recirculation.
 In this interaction, the spanwise vorticity is again readily converted
 into streamwise vorticity resulting in a saturation of streamwise vortices
 in the trailing edge.

The effect of centrifugal force driving the generation of streamwise vortices
 were also studied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Their study draws the analogy between the effect of streamline curvature
 and buoyancy forces due to the density gradients on the turbulence structure
 of shear layers.
 They concluded that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the effects of curvature on the apparent mixing length are appreciable if
 the shear-layer thickness exceeds roughly 1/300 of the radius of curvature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\delta}{R}>\frac{1}{300}$
\end_inset

.
 With the local curvature along the streamline maintained at about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01m$
\end_inset

, this translates to a sufficient condition that the shear layer is susceptible
 to curvature effects if the shear layer thickness is more than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01/300=3\times10^{-5}m$
\end_inset

.
 From the mean velocity profile for the flow around the cusp, the shear
 layer thickness near the shedding region is roughly 0.002m as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:shearprofile"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, which is about 60 times the requirement for the instability.
 Hence, the cove shear layer is clearly in the unstable regime related to
 curvature instabilities.
 In addition, any assumptions of linearity of the resulting interactions
 may be too exacting as well.
 According to the analysis of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the curvature Richardson numbers that allow linearity are of the order
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 In the cove shear layer, the curvature Richardson number is near saturation
 at a value of 2, and hence suggest a strongly non-linear regime.

Spanwise cell formation for spanwise velocity and vorticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second phenomenon pertinent to the cove flow dynamics is the appearance
 of spanwise modulation.
 The mean velocity and pressure fields develop spanwise cells when the flow
 is fully developed, with the spanwise modulation best recognizable in the
 spanwise component of velocity.
 Alternating directions of spanwise velocity can be noted, as shown in Figure

, with wave numbers varying consistently with nature of cove vortex shape.
 The strongest fluctuations associated with these cells appears to be attached
 to the cove flow shear layer, and is present dominantly inside the cove
 region.
 The flow is also modulated on the concave side of the flow curvature at
 slat gap.

Most recent findings of spanwise modulated behavior in cavity flows that
 are relevant to cove dynamics is the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which were inspired by an earlier work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

.
 They characterized the flow in open cavities at a moderate Reynolds number
 range less than 
\begin_inset Formula $1.1\times10^{4}$
\end_inset

 to demonstrate that spanwise modulations of similar nature occurs in open
 cavity flows.
 They characterized such behavior as a result of local curvature of the
 flow.
 When the flow recirculates around the closed walls inside the cavity, the
 streamlines are curved along with a no-slip conditioning at the walls.
 Such curvature is hence subject to the curvature led instability and satisfy
 the Rayleigh criteria that the angular momentum decreases with respect
 the radial direction of streamline curvature.
 Note that this phenomena is now consistent with the fact that cove flow
 aeroacoustics are closely related to open cavity flows in that the aeroacoustic
 resonance mechanism driven by the cove shear layer is understood in close
 analogy to the well-known Rossiter mechanism for cavity resonance.
 This identification of spanwise modulated behavior of the flow is a new
 contribution to the slat noise literature in this thesis and hence we try
 to document the same as much as possible using the data obtained using
 the simulations.

's moderate Reynolds numbers studied for open cavity flows.
 Also as mentioned in the previous subsection, the curvature Richardson
 number for this case is significantly higher than regimes considered for
 study of linear growth rate of the curvature instability.
 Hence this spanwise modulation is suggested as a result of saturation of
 possibly non-linear instability arising from the centrifugal effects in
 the cove recirculation.
 The initial curvature of the shear layer can be noted to be a good indicator
 of the strength of curvature effects.
 In Case 22, the shear layer radius of curvature is 0.025m, same order of
 magnitude as the slat chord, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}\approx0.039m$
\end_inset

.
 This results in a curvature Richardson number of 1.1 in the early shear
 layer.
 The resulting shape of the cove recirculation region is shown in Figure

.
 As can be noted in comparison with other cases, the curvature Richardson
 number of Case 22 is moderate between the range of 0.2 and 1.6 for other
 cases.
 This case develops a spanwise wavenumber of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{z}=0.2/3=0.067m$
\end_inset

, with three wavelengths fit to the spanwise domain length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2m$

The pressure field inside the recirculation bubble is also interesting in
 that there does not exit a spanwise uniform low pressure core for the recircula
tion bubble.
 The mean pressure distribution is instead forming cells which are curved
 in their ends towards the shear layer and leads to formation of nodal planes
 towards which the flow converges and diverges.
 Such planes convect the low wavenumber Görtler vortices that are recirculating
 in the slat cove and leads to their concentration in these planes where
 the flow converges.
 From the comparison of the pressure and velocity fields, it appears also
 that the convergent planes tend to have the center of recirculation deeper
 into the cove whereas as for divergent planes, where the flow convect fluid
 away from the plane, the center of recirculation is closer to the shear
 layer.
 This means that spanwise flow velocity is driven by establishment of mean
 pressure distribution developed as a result of the centrifugal effect.
 On the contrary, if the nodal planes developed a higher pressure distribution,
 it could have been reasoned as s stagnation effect that converging fluid
 mass drives the pressure field modulation, but however this is not the
 case.
 The centrifugal effect of the shear layer flow generates radially outward
 flow which elicit a response from the flow pressure distribution to have
 a low pressure inner region at the center of the bubble.
 However, this behavior is not stable in the spanwise direction and hence
 a homogeneous low pressure center of circulation is not absent, and instead
 a wavy pattern is formed resulting in the convergent and divergent planes
 where the fluid mass is redistributed accordingly.

\begin_layout Problem*

\series bold
Why does the fluid want to form spanwise modulations instead of a spanwise
 homogeneous cove flow where the centrifugal effect is balanced by the radial
 pressure gradient?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a fundamental question about the Navier-Stokes behavior.
 The conservation of momentum of fluid in rotating configuration is famously
 unstable to perturbations along the axis of rotation.
 The Taylor-Couette configuration of flow between two rotating cylinders
 is a classical example where, if the Rayleigh criterion is satisfied, and
 if the flow is within the unstable range of Taylor numbers, the flow develops
 axisymmetric tubes of rotating fluids stacked along the axis of rotation.
 At higher Taylor numbers, which denotes the ratio of the centrifugal force
 to the viscous forces in a fluid, the flow also tends to develop spiral
 wavy patterns.
 The complexity of this configuration and the richness of this problem is
 evident from the variety of regimes for a Taylor-Couette system as described
 by

 They characterized a system of concentric cylinders based on the inner
 and outer-cylinder Reynolds numbers, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{o}$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting 2-dimensional domain produces Taylor vortices, wavy vortices,
 modulated wavy vortices, and spiral vortices to mention a few, and are
 reproduced from their original work in Figure

For the slat cove flow behavior, we believe that the most relevant region
 is that of co-rotating cylinders.
 This is because the inner and outer flow in the slat cove have the same
 sense of rotation but different speeds.
 Hence it must be possible to identify the slat cove flow behavior in terms
 of an equivalent inner and outer flow Reynolds number.
 In comparison with the Taylor-Couette flows, in can be noticed in Figure

 that TC flow tends to have an asymptotic behavior towards Azimuthally laminar
 flow with weak Ekman vortices (AZI).
 Hence it is convincingly possible that effect of cove recirculation and
 centrifugal forces are responsible for the formation of the spanwise modulation
s in slat cove.
 However, this notice of spanwise modulation was not the primary motive
 of our study and hence we do not engage a fundamental analysis of this
 phenomenon.
 Nevertheless we intend to convince the reader of its significance and that
 it is not possible to have a complete understanding of slat cove flow without
 characterizing this aspect.

That being said, we now proceed to investigate the dataset.
 Variation of slat position with respect to the main element provides a
 way to compare the effect of cove recirculation on the formation of the
 modes.
 For this we choose to compare cases which have a sufficient variety of
 the slat shear layer shape.
 We choose Case 22 as a reference case as this is the most noisy case available
 in the dataset and also having the farfield noise spectra closest to experiment
al case.
 For comparison, three other cases are chosen, which are Cases 5, 29, and
 11, from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:allcases"
plural "false"
caps "false"

 and are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Case 5, the slat position is move closer to the main element by reducing
 the slat overlap.
 This has resulted in a configuration where the slat trailing edge is positioned
 downstream of the main element leading edge, however still with a sufficient
 slat gap for avoiding choking of the ejected flow.
 This case hence maintains a high velocity profile along the mean shear
 layer while moving the impingement location deeper into the cove away from
 the slat trailing edge.
 For the initial region of the shear layer, this means that initial radius
 of curvature is reduced while maintaining a sufficiently high flow velocity.
 Hence this case is expected to display and amplified effect of the shear
 layer curvature effect.
 Accordingly it can be noted that the case develops 10 spanwise cells, with
 a corresponding spanwise wavenumber 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{z}=\frac{N_{z}}{L_{z}}=\frac{5}{0.2}=25$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the spanwise wavenumber quantitatively can be sensitive to the
 spanwise extend of the domain since the periodic condition influence the
 wavenumber selection mechanism by provide a hard boundary condition of
 the length of the domain.
 However, given that all our simulations are conducted using the same spanwise
 extend, the wavenumber of the cells remains a useful representation for
 comparing the cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Case 22 and 29, the resulting spanwise wavelength is 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{z}=15\text{ and }20$
\end_inset

.
 The curvature Richardson number on the initial shear layer as seen in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Curvature-Richardson-Number"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is at 1.2.
 Hence this case can be reasoned to be on the interface between the stability
 modes of the spanwise instability, leading to a shift of the selected wavenumbe
r.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Case 11, the slat positioning is such that the trailing edge is again
 close to the main element however with a much smaller slat gap than Case
 5, leading to a choking of the flow.
 Hence the flow velocity is smaller along the shear, in agreement with the
 larger cove flow and also with a lower curvature of the initial shear layer.
 Hence this case is an example of the case with significantly smaller effect
 of the centrifugal forces on the flow.
 As can be noted, this case does not form spanwise modulations in the mean
 flow.

Effect of cove recirculation on the slat noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
The spanwise coherence of these vortices is a crucial factor that affect
 their aeroacoustics.
 The efficiency of impinging vortices to drive the acoustic mechanism –
 which generate an acoustic wave that travel back to the slat cusp to excite
 the aeroacoustic resonance – depends on the spanwise coherence of the structure.
 If the impinging structure is spanwise homogeneous, it will lead to generation
 of acoustic waves which are also nearly spanwise homogeneous leading to
 a two dimensional resonance loop.
 This in theory must be related to the strength of tonal peaks in the far-field
 acoustic spectra and hence arises the importance of phenomena responsible
 for the transfer of vorticity from spanwise to streamwise direction.
 Moreover, it is possible that the acoustic wave generation mechanism responsibl
e for the resonance loop is not directly due to the impingement of the vortices
 but due to the scattering of the incident pressure field the eddies by
 the trailing edge.
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, a spanwise oriented eddy while passing by the trailing edge causes an
 abrupt change of the incident pressure at the trailing edge.
 The variation is coherent in the spanwise direction and lead to generation
 of an amplified dipole sound source.
 On the contrary, in the case of a streamwise oriented eddy convected past
 a sharp trailing edge, the temporal variation of pressure distribution
 at the trailing edge is not significant and such eddies does not generate
 a strong noise source.
 Hence naturally, the composition of turbulence that flow past the trailing
 edge has to be spanwise coherent with a lower proportion of streamwise
 structure for the case to have strong tonal components.
