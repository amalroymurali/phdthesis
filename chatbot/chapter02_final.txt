\begin_layout Standard
This chapter aims to review the existing literature necessary to facilitate
 the study of slat noise.
 Given that the aeroacoustic mechanism in slat noise is a composite of fluid
 dynamic interactions arising from its shear layer behavior, trailing edge
 scattering, and aeroacoustic resonance, and that the three are simultaneously
 active under the setting of a cavity flow, we start by presenting these
 fundamental processes separately before presenting the actual slat noise
 literature.
 Thanks to the very recent revitalization of research interest in aeroacoustics,
 many of these topics have been thoroughly reviewed on their historic context
 and developments to until as late as the previous year.
 Hence we do not reproduce such extensive versions here but only present
 their summaries with a perspective pertinent to our intended study.

 The flow past a trailing edge convects the turbulent structures who themselves

.
 The resulting fluctuations in the immediate vicinity of a sharp trailing
 edge are then scattered by the edge and results in a dipole like source
 centered at the edge.
 Although a debated topic, this effect was suggested to be largely independent
 of the unsteady Kutta condition except for high frequency noise and non-linear
 effects in the directivities

 The farfield sound intensity is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{5}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the free stream Mach number
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Compared to the noise of free turbulence which scales with 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{8}$
\end_inset

, and that of unsteady surface fluctuations which scale with 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{6}$
\end_inset

, the trailing edge scattering serves as a dominant mechanism when flow
 speeds are sufficiently low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the intensity of the farfield noise, the trailing edge scattering efficiency
 is dependent on the spanwise coherence length
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cavalieri2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is due to the fact that when the structures are spanwise oriented
 – with respect to the largely two dimensional flow – the input pressure
 fluctuations at the TE will also be coherent along the spanwise edge length
 leading to their strong radiation by scattering.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, if the distance between the passing eddy and the TE is increased such
 that the Helmholtz number 
\begin_inset Formula $k\bar{r_{0}}\gg1$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{r_{0}}$
\end_inset

 is the distance of the passing eddy from the edge and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the wavenumber of the radiated acoustic wave of interest, the trailing
 edge noise efficiency decreases.
 But within the proximity of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\bar{r_{0}}<0.5$
\end_inset

, the noise level increases by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\bar{r_{0}}^{-3}$
\end_inset

.
 This partially can be attributed to the effective coherence of the incident
 fluctuations which also is inversely proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{r_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The incident fluctuations at the trailing edge can thus be used as the input
 to model far-field TE noise as in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Amiet1976"

\end_inset

.
 His model uses the pressure fluctuations at a location slightly upstream
 of the trailing edge together with an infinite chord assumption.
 This then by the Schwarzchild technique for the wave equation of the acoustic
 potential enables calculating the pressure variation across the sharp trailing
 edge which then act as a distribution of acoustic sources at the TE.
 Then the radiation can be propagated to the farfield by calculating noise
 using the canonical Green's function.
 This method thus provides a physically valid method of calculation of the
 TE scattering phenomena and also validated the theory.
 An extension to the TE noise theory for engineering application was also
 given by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 where the possible backscattering from the leading edge of a finite chord
 blade was taken in to account for the calculation.

 studied the data from large eddy simulation and used Spectral Proper Orthogonal
 Decomposition (SPOD) to isolate the dominant structures that are responsible
 for the pressure fluctuations at the trailing edge.
 Their analysis suggested that the largest eigen value modes represented
 most part of the acoustic energy.
 The corresponding modes were also shown to have an extended structure spanning
 from the location of boundary layer detachment to the trailing edge.
 They hence suggested that the trailing edge noise is related to non-compact
 source fluctuations.
 They also suggested that the phase of the fluctuations also have an impact
 such that the maximum source efficiency occurs when the incoming perturbations
 are out of phase between the suction side and the pressure side.

Other mechanisms of Airfoil Self-Noise

Airfoil Self-Noise 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Airfoil self-noise refers to the noise generated by a single element airfoil
 due to interactions with the turbulence developing along its surface
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Brooks1989,Moreau2009,ArroyoRamo2023"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The primary source of turbulence here is the boundary layer turbulence
 generated by the boundary layer flow over the walls.
 For subsonic speeds, the major noise source mechanism is the above mentioned
 TBL-TE noise phenomenon and contributes to a broadband noise in the farfield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the TE phenomena another major noise mechanism occurs when the
 airfoil is stalled
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Moreau2009"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 When it happens that the flow on the suction side of the airfoil separates
 prematurely, before reaching the trailing edge, large scale vortex structures
 are shed from the suction side of the airfoil, leading to strong generation
 of turbulence.
 In a mildly separated flow, the noise mechanism will stay similar to the
 trailing edge radiation but due to stronger incoming vorticity at TE.
 Hence a broadband increase by about 10 dBdB over TBL-TE

\begin_inset Formula $St\in[0.02,0.03]$

\color black
.
 As the angle of attack increases, the flow separation point moves towards
 the leading edge and the noise progressively shifts to a lower frequency
 range.

\color inherit
 During deep stall, the airfoil operates as a bluff body and the noise is
 generated from the full surface of the chord and the low frequency component
 are diminished together with the development of narrow band peaks in 
\color black
same Strouhal range
\color inherit
.
 These are attributed to the periodic shedding of large scale vortices and
 their interaction with the leading and trailing edges
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Laratro2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The sharpness of transition from mild stall noise to deep stall noise is
 also determined by the thickness of the airfoil.
 The stall noise is a dominant component of the total noise when present
 but however is less prevalent in high-lift applications.
 It is so since the high-lift device (HLD) primarily delays the stall on
 the main body, i.e.
 an HLD allows the airfoil to operate at a higher angles of attack without
 initiating stall due to the secondary turbulent flow generated by the leading
 edge slat.
 The large scale periodic vortex shedding from the suction side wall on
 an airfoil is hence replaced by the reattachment of a periodically oscillating
 shear layer from the slat trailing edge for the HLD.
 The only related possible mechanism in HLDs is thus of a mild-stall condition
 on its main element with strongly turbulent inflow conditions due to presence
 of upstream cove flow.
 This can potentially explain mid-frequency broadband components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third noise mechanism for airfoils arise from the vortex shedding from
 a low Reynolds number laminar boundary layer on the airfoil wall.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 were the early experimenters to show that an airfoil placed in a uniform
 laminar flow generated broadband noise with dominant tonal components and
 the tone frequencies followed a ladder-type evolution with the flow velocity.
 The laminar boundary layers at low Reynolds numbers without pressure gradients
 are stable according to the Rayleigh criteria.
 However, any slight incoming perturbation can excite the boundary layer
 (BL) instabilities.
 The most unstable modes in a viscous laminar parallel flat 2D BL flow are
 known as the Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lowson1994"

\end_inset

.
 These pressure and velocity perturbations, when excited at a source location
 on the airfoil surface by external factors, grow along the streamwise direction
 until their amplitude saturates non-linearly into turbulence generating
 vortices which are then convected past the trailing edge
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Longhouse1977"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The trailing edge scattering then generates acoustic waves that travel
 back to the location of the T-S wave onset to enhance their excitation,
 thereby completing an aeroacoustic loop
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Vittal-shenoy2023"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This mode of resonance thus destabilizes a laminar boundary layer on an
 airfoil even when there is no adverse pressure gradient along the wall.
 Since the TS instability is receptive to a broadband range of incoming
 perturbations, the presence of the turbulent boundary layer on one side
 of the airfoil is sufficient to excite the instability on both sides, given
 the angle of attack and Reynolds numbers.
 The resulting noise spectra will also have quasi-tones related to the shedding
 rates at the trailing edge

A fourth mechanism for airfoil self-noise arises from the trailing edge
 shape.
 A blunt trailing edge can facilitate shedding of vorticity if the edge
 thickness is comparatively larger than the boundary layer thicknesses.
 The vortex shedding is certain if the ratio of TE thickness to boundary
 layer displacement thickness is larger than 2.0

 The pressure fluctuations associated with the vortices shed, which form
 a von Karman street downstream of the TE, are scattered by the edges resulting
 in an efficient noise source.
 The associated far-field noise is typically a tone in the high frequency
 range.
 A similarity of the spectra was obtained when plotted as function of Strouhal
 numbers based on the TE thickness and the displacement thicknesses of the
 incoming boundary layer

 The St of the tones are in the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $St=[0.2,0.3]$

\begin_layout Standard
This feature of a blunt trailing edge tonal noise is important for slat
 aeroacoustics.
 The trailing edge of the slat geometry in the reference configuration of
 VALIANT, introduced in the previous chapter, has a thickness of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\,mm$
\end_inset

.
 The peak velocity of the ejected flow from the slat gap rises to approximately
 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 times the ambient speed and hence a velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,m/s$
\end_inset

 can be taken an an estimate.
 Consequently the resulting trailing edge shedding frequency will be around
 
\begin_inset Formula $20\,kHz$
\end_inset

 and hence can explain the high frequency hump typical for slat noise spectra.
 However, as shown by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Roger2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the coherence of the eddies along the slat trailing edge will be an important
 factor determining the source efficiency.
 In the slat cove flow, this source will hence be weakened by the vorticity
 dynamics in the cove which favors a disintegration of the spanwise coherent
 vorticity from the cusp while being convected towards the trailing edge.
 Moreover, given that for the high speed ejection at the slat gap, the vortex
 shedding noise is at the very high frequency range of 
\begin_inset Formula $20 kHzkHz$
\end_inset

, it does not interact directly with the characteristic resonance mechanisms
 that occur at much lower frequencies.

Cavity Noise
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cavity noise is another fundamental phenomenon of aeroacoustics which is
 of importance for the slat noise.
 The recent view of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "HamiltonSmith2024"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, presents most of the significant developments.
 The canonical cavity flow addressed in fluid dynamics is a regular shaped
 rectangular cavity under a grazing flow, where a turbulent shear layer
 develops over the open side.
 The shear layer at the upstream edge of the open side develops the canonical
 K-H instability and leads to vortex shedding.
 These vortices then impinge on the downstream edge of the cavity leading
 to partial convection of the flow past the edge and partial recirculation
 of the reminiscent flow within the volume of the cavity.
 The resulting oscillatory motion at the slat trailing edge leads to periodic
 variations of the static pressure inside the cavity which then leads to
 periodic oscillation of the shear layer itself.
 The perturbations that reach back to the leading edge then provide the
 trigger for the K-H instability.
 The combination of vortex shedding and acoustic waves form and aeroacoustic
 feedback loop that leads to the formation and impingement of strongly coherent
 large vorticity structures thereby generating acoustic waves at the frequency
 corresponding to the acoustic wave propagation time.
 These oscillations were understood early on by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Strouhal1878"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to be primarily determined by the incoming velocity and associated length
 scales which led him to formulate the non-dimensional characteristic frequency
 referred to as the Strouhal number.
 The shear layer oscillations and the impinging vortices were theorized
 and studied later as an aeroacoustic resonance by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Rossiter1964"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 where he demonstrated, using shadowgraphs, that the regular impingement
 of vortices at the trailing edge and their time of shedding were synchronized,
 resulting in amplification of the pressure perturbations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flow dynamics developed in a cavity is largely dependent on the geometric
 proportions of the cavity.
 For the rectangular shape, the streamwise flow types are generally categorized
 into open and closed
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Charwat1961"

.
 The configuration is referred to as open if the streamwise length to depth
 ratio, 
\begin_inset Formula $L/D$
\end_inset

 is less than 5 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "HamiltonSmith2024"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this configuration the shear layer reattaches the downstream of the
 trailing edge and hence causes large shear layer oscillations to occur
 which are excited by the internal recirculation.
 Both deep cavity tones are produced together with Rossiter modes in this
 case.
 On the contrary, the flow is treated as closed when 
\begin_inset Formula $L/D>12$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the streamwise length of the cavity is sufficiently high
 such that shear layer from the leading edge curves inwards to reattach
 with the cavity floor before separating again at upstream of the trailing
 edge.
 This case hence produces significant drag due to the stagnation of the
 flow inside the cavity

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is between these two extremes that the cavity flow is called transitional.
 When closer to the open configuration with 
\begin_inset Formula $5<L/D<7$
\end_inset

, the flow is predominantly open with the shear layer impinging at close
 proximity to the trailing edge.
 The flow often transition here between a closed mode or open mode depending
 on the incoming flow velocities.
 The transition here is also affected by the development of the flow in
 the third dimension which depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $L/W$

\begin_inset Formula $W$

 is the cross flow width as shown by

 This is attributed to the fact that the distance between the steps tends
 to obstruct the aeroacoustic loop.

The geometry of the cavity and their arrangement has also been observed
 to be important in view of the turbulence generated and noise characteristic.

\begin_layout Standard
The three dimensionality in cavity flows, as will be shown later, is an
 important aspect to understand the slat cove flow.
 In the rectangular cavity configuration, the cavity is referred to as wide
 
\begin_inset Formula $2D$
\end_inset

, if the width of the cavity is sufficiently high, typically 
\begin_inset Formula $L/W<<1$
\end_inset

.
 This is also the case of an spanwise infinite flow where the spanwise features
 of the flow dynamics are dispersed into the infinite domain.
 In contrast, for the case referred to as the Narrow 
\begin_inset Formula $3D$
\end_inset

 case, the spanwise width is limited by the presence of a wall constraining
 the domain such that 
\begin_inset Formula $L/W>1$
\end_inset

.
 In this case the three dimensional dynamics are retained locally within
 the flow resulting in their influence on the larger 
\begin_inset Formula $2D$
\end_inset

 flow.
 This is often the scenario if experimental investigation of the slat noise
 is carried out in a wind tunnel where the spanwise spacing of the lateral
 supporting plates is not sufficiently large.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the cove flow generated in a generic case, we know from the literature
 that the recirculation bubble roughly has a depth similar to the slat chord.
 For an experimental setup which has a slat chord of

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 estimates.
 Hence the cavity length to depth ratio approximates as close to

 flow phenomena.
 However, note that this comparison is widely inaccurate on the details
 since for a rectangular cavity, the cavity shape is a regular rectangle
 whereas in the cove flow, the cavity has the shape of the inner slat wall,
 which itself approximates as circular.
 More importantly, the shear layer in an open cavity flow bridges the open
 side in a dominantly linear path.
 In contrast the slat cove shear layer undergoes a curved path whose curvature
 itself lies in the linearly unstable regime.
 This is one perspective that we wish to study and to highlight to the community
 through our work.

Curved Shear Layer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A last but substantial of flow phenomena that we believe is necessary to
 understand slat cove dynamics is that of the curved shear layer.
 This is because the argument that the slat cove is spanwise homogeneous
 is the accepted notion among slat noise researchers thereby instructing
 the experiments to overlook spanwise variations.
 The fact is that in perspective of the cavity flow phenomena, the slat
 cove flow is a wide flow with an equivalent length to depth ratio larger
 than 1.
 However, the key difference here lies, according to our understanding,
 is that the shear layer in slate cove has a strongly curved trajectory
 with a slat chord based non-dimensional radius of curvature of 
\begin_inset Formula $R/C_{s}<0.5$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The effect of curvature on the nature of turbulence in a curved free shear
 layer is however sparingly attended as a fundamental problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The curved free shear layers however are sparingly analyzed fundamentally.
 Instead the problem is often approached from a perspective of the Görtler
 instability which is a dominant mechanism in the case of flow along a curved
 wall.

As mentioned in the introduction, the slat cove dynamics and noise mechanisms
 are understood largely in terms of the elementary mechanisms discussed
 above.
 Historically, in the very early developments on slat related noise studies,

 Sound Power Level (OASPL).
 This component which was observed in the flight data did not have specific
 tones.
 Consequently, the early slat noise model for flight conditions by

 noise isolated from the rest of the airframe noise sources by using a laborator
y scale test model.
 In these experiments, the high lift devices were found to have narrow band
 tones in addition to the broadband spectra.

 first hypothesized that these tones can originate from the vortex shedding
 of the blunt trailing edge but later reported that attempts to directly
 correlate the vortex shedding frequency to the thickness of the blunt trailing
 edge were not successful.
 Subsequently efforts were made to correlate the tone frequencies with the
 boundary layer displacement thickness which also did not bear fruit

 reported the discovery of

Gap tones
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and suggested that in both the slat cove and in case of jet shear layers,
 an aeroacoustic mechanism can explain the generation of acoustic tones.
 The frequency of the tones were also shown to be predictable by using only
 kinematic considerations, i.e.
 the time lag between the vortex shedding and the acoustic generation due
 to their interaction with the wall or the flow itself.
 This was the first suggestion that the slat tones could possibly be explained
 by an aeroacoustic resonance.
 Subsequent developments can be noted to be informed of both the tonal and
 broadband nature of slat noise with the broadband noise being the main
 focus for modelling flight test datasets

 The computational campaigns that followed then showed that the broadband

 can provide a good agreement with the far-field acoustics

 while

 showed that the tones have mode switching processes suggesting that they
 are associated with resonant processes.

 the free stream Mach number based on the dimensional analysis by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 and subsequently such a model was found to have reasonable agreements with
 their slat noise datasets from flight tests.
 However, in his work this correspondence of the scaling law was reported
 to be only nominal, derived from dimensional analysis, and the total slat
 noise behavior deviates to have a Mach number power dependency of 
\begin_inset Formula $5.3$
\end_inset

 to obtain a better agreement with observations, as first suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This also lies in between the noise efficiency of a classical trailing
 edge source (
\begin_inset Formula $M^{5}$
\end_inset

) and that of a simple airfoil in a turbulent field (
\begin_inset Formula $M^{6}$
\end_inset

) and the difference can be attributed to the propagation effects which
 is determined by the presence and complex nature of the flow on the slat-airfoi
l configuration.
 The farfield directivity of slat noise also reproduces largely a dipole
 shaped radiation centered at the trailing edge of the slat as shown in
 the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

, providing further evidence that the trailing edge mechanism is the driver
 of the broadband noise.

The explanations for broadband and tonal noise are thus mostly satisfactory
 for their source mechanisms.
 Accordingly, modern investigations of slat noise attempt to capture the
 farfield noise quantitatively and engineering efforts attempt to reduce
 the noise by using geometrical interventions.

 showed that the strength of the shear layer vorticity determines the strength
 of the radiated noise.
 The former used a blade seal to reduce the strength of the shed vorticity
 while the latter showed that the perturbations near the slat gap are correlated
 to the broadband noise in the farfield.

 They also reported that the tonal components had a Strouhal number which
 depended on the angle of attack.
 In their suggestion, this was reasoned to be an effect of the variation
 of the shear layer length where a longer vortex trajectory would cause
 a longer travel times for the eddies and thus a reduction of the resonant
 Strouhal numbers.

 who deduced that the resonance follows the same phenomenology as the aforementi
oned Rossiter mechanism.
 The resulting formula based on kinematic considerations use the vortex
 shedding location as the slat cusp and the trailing edge as the location
 of impingement of the trailing edge.
 The travel time for the spanwise coherent vortices shed from the cusp then
 provides the major time delay and, together with the feedback time for
 the acoustic wave from the trailing edge to reach back at the cusp, it
 provides the total time period for the resonant oscillation.
 The formula for the slat's Rossiter modes according to

\end_inset

 is the ratio of shear layer length to the acoustic path, and

 This formula assumes that the slat tones are harmonics of a fundamental
 which is determined by the longest possible resonance loop when

 harmonic behavior and give in to non-linear interactions

 The theoretical model of noise generation from turbulence, its propagation

 in his approach to derive an approximate analytical form for the slat noise

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A review of the basic phenomena related to slat noise, namely the TE noise,
 airfoil self noise, and cavity noise, are reviewed in this chapter together
 with the current state of art of leading edge slat noise.
 These phenomena in our understanding is necessary to understand the dynamics
 and noise generation in the airfoil configuration.
 With the conclusion that there are sound advancements in both analytical
 modeling of tonal noise and data-driven methods using LBM, we now choose
 the data-driven paradigm as the basis of this work.
 This aligns with our objective of obtaining a fast-turn around aeroacoustic
 prediction tool that can be used at a design engineers desk during design
 optimizations.
 For this, we deploy the commercial LBM solver ProLB, together with a Ffowcs
 Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy method to develop an acoustic prediction
 framework.
 The data is first used to investigate the slat noise phenomena in relation
 to the above mentioned basic mechanisms of noise generation and then to
 put forward a data-driven framework that enables to bypass the expensive
 LBM or acoustic analogy methods to obtain a noise estimate.
 This latter choice is primarily motivated by the aim is to develop a slat
 noise prediction framework that is agnostic to the geometrical complexities.
