Acoustic Pulse Propagation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Wave Propagation according to Linearized Navier-Stokes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A reduced form of linearized Navier-Stokes equation that captures the adiabatic
 sound propagation in an isothermal fluid can be written of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(c_{0}^{2}+\left[\frac{4}{3}\nu+\nu_{B}\right]\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)\nabla^{2}P^{\prime}=\frac{\partial^{2}P^{\prime}}{\partial t^{2}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which represent a lossy wave equation.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the thermodynamic speed of sound, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\mu/\rho_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the kinematic shear viscosity and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{B}=\mu_{B}/\rho_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the kinematic bulk viscosity of the fluid.
 It has been shown by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Dellar2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that the kinematic bulk viscosity in LBM-BGK isothermal model is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{B}=2\nu/3$
\end_inset

 and hence the effective viscosity is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\frac{4}{3}\nu+\nu_{B}\right]=2\nu$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equation is thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(c_{0}^{2}+2\nu\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\right)\nabla^{2}P^{\prime}=\frac{\partial^{2}P^{\prime}}{\partial t^{2}}\label{eq:effectiveNSac}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here a definition of the viscous relaxation time, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{s}$
\end_inset

 can be useful and is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau_{s}=\left(\frac{4}{3}\eta+\eta_{B}\right)/\rho_{0}c^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and typical values of this quantity are approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-10}s$
\end_inset

 for gases and 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-12}s$
\end_inset

 in liquids.
 Now, a plane wave solution can be assumed of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P'=\hat{A}\exp\left[i\left(\hat{k}x-\hat{\omega}t\right)\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On substituting this equation to Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:effectiveNSac"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 one obtains the dispersion relation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(c_{0}^{2}-i\hat{\omega}2\nu\right)\hat{k}^{2}=\hat{\omega}^{2}\label{eq:dispersion_relation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Temporal Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 is prescribed as an arbitrary real wave number vector 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, a discretised version of Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:effectiveNSac"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 reduces to a generalized eigen value problem.
 The analytical solution for this problem was described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Marie2009"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and is of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\omega}=-ik^{2}\nu\pm kc_{o}\sqrt{1-\left(k\nu/c_{0}\right)^{2}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solutions thus represent the acoustic modes propogating with phase speeds
 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{T}=Re(\hat{\omega})/k$
\end_inset

 and temporal dissipation 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{T}=-Im(\hat{\omega})$
\end_inset

, hence of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P^{\prime}=\hat{A}\exp\left(-\alpha_{T}t\right)\exp\left[ik\left(x-c_{T}t\right)\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{cccc}
c_{T}=c_{o}\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{k\nu}{c_{0}}\right)^{2}} & and & \alpha_{T}=k^{2}\nu\end{array}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spatial Analysis
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Spatial-Analysis"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If instead of prescribing a real spatial wave number, we can specify a real
 frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\omega}$
\end_inset

, and Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:dispersion_relation"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 can be solved for the complex wave number 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}=\pm\frac{\omega}{\sqrt{c_{0}^{2}-i\omega2\nu}}$
\end_inset

.
 In practice, this captures the distortion in the wavelength and decay of
 amplitude as the plane wave of fixed frequency propagates in space.
 Now, the phase speed is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{S}=\omega/Re(\hat{k})$
\end_inset

 and spatial dissipation rate as 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{S}=Im(\hat{k})$
\end_inset

, thereby giving the form of propagating wave solution as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P^{\prime}=\hat{A}\exp\left(-\alpha_{S}x\right)\exp\left[i\omega\left(x/c_{S}-t\right)\right]\label{eq:plane_wave_soln}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c_{S}=\sqrt{2}c_{0}\sqrt{\frac{1+\left(\omega\tau_{S}\right)^{2}}{\sqrt{1+\left(\omega\tau_{S}\right)^{2}}+1}}\text{ and }\alpha_{S}=\frac{\omega}{\sqrt{2}c_{0}}\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{1+\left(\omega\tau_{S}\right)^{2}}-1}{1+\left(\omega\tau_{S}\right)^{2}}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Gaster Transformation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gaster transformation deals with relating the spatial and temporal formulations.
 If we assume that the spatial wavenumber 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 and temporal frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\omega}$
\end_inset

 are both analytic functions of each other in the complex domain, then Cauchy-Ri
emann equations can be used used to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $Re(\hat{k}_{spatial})\approx Re(\hat{k}_{temporal})$
\end_inset

 if we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $Re(\hat{\omega}_{spatial})\approx Re(\hat{\omega}_{temporal})$
\end_inset

 and neglect higher order terms.
 Then the temporal and spatial dissipation rates satisfy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\alpha_{T}}{\alpha_{S}}=C_{g}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the group velocity defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{g}=\frac{\partial Re(\hat{\omega})}{\partial Re(\hat{k})}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Useful approximation for Isothermal Adiabatic Pulse Propagation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the above three piece wise analyses, we can make approximations for
 the case of a typical fluid whose kinematic viscosity 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=1.5\times10^{-5}m^{2}/s$
\end_inset

 and thermodynamic sound speed is 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}=343 m/sm/s$
\end_inset

.
 Here the terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k\nu/c_{0}$
\end_inset

 are of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the phase velocities and dissipation rates from temporal analysis
 reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{T}\approx c_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{T}\approx k^{2}\nu$
\end_inset

 whereas the spatial sound speed and dissipation rates from spatial analysis
 reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{S}\approx c_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{S}\approx\frac{\omega^{2}}{2c_{0}}\tau_{s}=\frac{\omega^{2}}{c_{0}}\frac{\nu}{c_{0}^{2}}$
\end_inset

.

Oval Surfaces

An oval shaped surface is first tested which is placed close to the airfoil
 to obtain a close fit to the surface, but large enough to contain the ejected
 vortices from the slat cove.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be noted, while using the oval surface, the farfield prediction at
 the suction side tends to generate spurious noise in frequencies greater
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $5 kHzkHz$
\end_inset

.
 This is attributed to the effect of vorticity structures crossing the FWH
 surface which makes the quadrupole source terms significant
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Mendez2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and needs to be included in the calculation.
 However, the volume integrals are computationally inefficient and instead
 surface truncation or data averaging is done such that neglecting them
 generates non-significant errors.
 As can be noted in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:truncatedfwhspectra"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the spurious hump disappears in the calculated spectra if the surface
 is truncated at the downstream edge region.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This truncation, however, also cause a drop in the levels for broadband
 range.
 On comparing the sound levels in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

, the drop in levels are approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $4.5 dBdB$
\end_inset

, on average, suggesting that the contribution for farfield sound from the
 truncated region is significant across the range.
 A further truncation of the surface to use only the bottom surface shows
 that a further filtering of the high frequency range is obtained but with
 little to no further loss in the broadband levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color blue
For very low frequency, the levels drop with surface truncation and is attribute
d to the fact that in the FWH routine, the fluctuating pressure is obtained
 by subtracting a uniform mean pressure from the FWH surface recording.
 This mean pressure is not the locally averaged pressure for each node and
 hence leads to an erroneous DC component in the predicted PSD.
 
\color black
Nevertheless,
\color inherit
 very low frequencies typically 
\begin_inset Formula $<600Hz$
\end_inset

 are not considered amenable to interpretation in the experimental data
 as well due to the presence of jet shear layer noise and other background
 noises in the experimental setup.
 Also since these additional sources are absent in the simplified simulation,
 levels at low frequencies are expected to be lower than the experiment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On further visualization of the vorticity in the suction side using the
 Q-criterion, it can be seen that the upper side of the surface inevitably
 cross the path of large scale vortex structures with small magnitude of
 vorticity.
 This is visualized in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 using isocontours of a low value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{c}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{Q_{c}}{M^{2}}=200$
\end_inset

.
 To avoid this problem we update the FWH surface using a larger C shaped
 surface that will allow for the upper surface to be placed farther from
 the HLD.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The upper and lower surface regions contribute differently to the observer
 on the suction and pressure side of the main element.
 This can be seen in the prediction made for an observer at the suction
 side by using only the bottom side of the surface.
 The bottom surface recovers the same levels as of the experiment giving
 excellent agreement for the higher frequencies.
 The tone levels are identical with the surface truncated downstream only,
 whereas the lower frequencies below 
\begin_inset Formula $800Hz$
\end_inset

 drops further.
 The contribution to the suction side observers from the top surface is
 found to be of lower amplitude than the lower surface and hence the negligible
 contribution to the spectra.
 The FWH calculation is implemented such that there involves

\begin_layout Standard
The complete configuration of the wind tunnel setup of the original VALIANT
 experiment, which includes the converging duct and the lateral support
 plates, were simulated using the same simulation parameters of the free
 stream simulation.
 This simulation was setup by Airbus engineers (Dr.
 Maxime Itasse and Dr.
 Florian Guiho) and was reproduced at the ECL facility for the purpose of
 testing the version of the code for producing reference data.
 The full simulation requires significantly larger compute resources than
 free stream simulation since the three dimensional shear layers from the
 wind tunnel need to be resolved adequately to avoid spurious effects.
 Hence its needs a few adaptations which make the free stream simulation
 computationally cheaper while maintaining the same fidelity as when including
 the wind tunnel.
 As such, the wind tunnel simulation has the following differences from
 the free stream case:

Spanwise boundary conditions are set to wall boundaries with no slip at

 In free flow simulation, periodic conditions are applied on spanwise boundaries
 to mimic an infinite spanwise domain.

\begin_layout Enumerate
The experimental setup has a nozzle geometry which creates an unsteady shear
 layer around the airfoil whereas the free flow simulations have only the
 airfoil surface as a solid generating turbulence and vorticity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the case of simulation with the inclusion of tunnel geometry, the coordinate
 axis are chosen differently.
 The flow is now aligned such that the downstream axis is along the X-coordinate
 axis and the spanwise direction is along the Y-coordinate axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consequently, for spanwise periodic condition in the free stream case, the
 acoustic domain is theoretically infinite allowing the waves to propagate
 without being reflected by solid spanwise boundaries.
 However, the periodic condition numerically copies the data between the
 spanwise boundaries thereby enforcing congruence of the flow variables
 at both boundaries.
 Hence, although the domain is infinite for acoustic propagation, it may
 trigger spurious periodic behaviors in the flow with wavelengths that confer
 to the domain length.
 Another effect of the spanwise periodic condition is that it tends to exert
 spanwise homogeneity in the flow if the spanwise domain length is smaller
 than that which would allow three dimensionality to develop.
 This has been investigated in previous works for the same geometry as that
 used in the present simulations

 showed that for the development of three-dimensionality of the coherent
 structures in the cove region, a spanwise extend of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.8c_{s}$
\end_inset

 is necessary.
 For the current case simulated, this corresponds to a length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0312m$
\end_inset

 while the actual simulated span length is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2m$
\end_inset

 corresponding to more than 6 times the suggested value.
 Hence this factor is not expected to affect the features of the flow simulated
 in our case and the three dimensionality is expected to develop unhindered.

 The FWH surface shape remains the same as the chosen C-shape surface from
 Chapter 04, but is now placed inside the tunnel such that the shear layer
 from the nozzle edges develops outside the FWH surface completely.
 Additionally, with a reduced signal length, the computation leads to spectra
 with a lower resolution.

 It can be noted that a good agreement is obtained regarding the tonal frequenci
es in both cases.
 For the SPL, the first tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

 tends to be captured adequately by the wind tunnel simulation whereas it
 was almost vanishing in the free stream simulation.
 A good agreement can be seen in general for all higher frequency tones
 (not all harmonics) along with consistently higher broadband SPL simulations.
 The higher SPL suggests that the pressure fluctuations in the cove are
 more energetic in the simulations than the experiment.

 The wall pressure distribution on the slat and the pressure side of the
 airfoils shows a good agreement with the experimental values for both cases.
 However, there is a strong deviation of the suction peak at the leading
 edge of airfoil for both airfoil and the slat, and delivers a value lower
 than the experimental case.
 The free flow simulation also shows an overall shift in the data due to
 uncertainity arising from the mean pressure value

The discrepancies in the suction peak is hence suspected to be the effect
 of irregularity in the measurement of inlet velocity, which in our investigatio
ns was not uniform at the nozzle exit of the wind tunnel simulation, suggesting
 that the potential effect of the airfoil distorts the inlet velocity profile.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{\infty}$

 value used can hence lead to an erroneous 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$

 As can be noted the wall pressure spectra along the wall shows a progressive
 variation of the tonal peaks corresponding to the same in far-field spectra.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For slat geometry, in region near the cusp the turbulent fluctuations are
 weaker compared to the trailing edge and hence captures the tonal frequencies
 with a higher level than the turbulent fluctuations.
 Near the trailing edge, these tonal features are submerged by the stronger
 levels of turbulence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the main element, the strongest peak is seen for Probe 21 for 1771Hz,
 corresponding to the first main tone.
 This location is also close to the cusp.
 For other probes which are farther from the cove but on the pressure side,
 the tones are visible with progressively weakened levels towards the trailing
 edge.
 On the suction side, much like the slat trailing edge, the turbulent flow
 submerges the tonal perturbations to render a largely broadband spectra.
 Towards the main element trailing edge on the suction side, the periodic
 perturbations from the cove are weak and represent the hydrodynamic perturbatio
ns due to the reattached turbulence.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enable reuse and further extension, the dataset we obtained from the
 current thesis work is documented here.
 It is first organized into cases representing different slat positions.
 For each case, the data used to generate the LBM simulation case files
 are available in the pre-processing folder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preproc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the connected scripts in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

templates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folder for editing the files according to case specific needs.
 For the template based setup that we used, the configuration files are
 largely the same for different cases except for the slat geometry file
 which is updated with the coordinate translation necessary according to
 the slat coordinates.
 For each case we then use the following conventions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Case names and regular expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each test case for slat position coordinate is represented by a regular
 expression (regex).
 The four slat coordinates, namely Angle of Attack (AOA), Slat Deflection
 Angle (SDA), Slat Gap (SGP), and Slat Overlap (SOL), together with the
 coordinate values are used to form the case specific regex.
 Characters `p' and `n' are prepended to the value to denote positive and
 negative signs respectively.
 The python3 snippet used to generate the regex, given the four coordinate
 values are given below.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Folder structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the simulation case data is stored in a folder named using the above-men
tioned regex.
 Within each case folder, the data is archived as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pre-processing - The `preproc' folder contains files that are inputs to
 the LBPre module.
 It includes case geometries in which the slat.stl file from master folder
 is transformed to obtain the file with case specific positioning, the probe
 coordinates transformed according to case requirement, and the FWH surface
 files.
 The data in this folder is then inputted to LBPre case file using its scripting
 features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Results - The folder `results' contains, for each of the simulated case,
 the data files generated by ProLB solver.
 The result files are formatted consistently across cases and contains the
 following:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Mean flow recording - MeanQuantities.xmf and corresponding .h5 data file:
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The flow recordings are generated for the full domain of simulation and
 are recorded at full resolution of the mesh.
 Temporal averaging corresponds to 5 chord pass times and recording starts
 from the latest possible time step in the simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
FWH surface recordings - FWH_PermeableSurface_Recording_outsurf.xmf and correspon
ding .h5 data file:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The FWH surface recordings are for velocity, pressure, and density data.
 Sampling rate is chosen according to requirements discussed in the main
 text.
 The recording frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $180405\,Hz$
\end_inset

, and has a total of 49200 timesteps enabling 6 averaging bins, with 8200
 steps per bin for the Welch method for PSD calculation.
 The resulting spectra can be obtained at a resolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $44Hz$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Q-criterion and Vorticity - UnsteadyCoveRecordingRes1Set#_grad.xmf and correspond
ing .h5 data file:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Unsteady data for Q-Criterion and Vorticity vectors in the slat cove region
 are recorded for visualizing the cove vortex behavior.
 The sampling rate is kept lower than FWH surface recording to save storage
 space and its sampling at 
\begin_inset Formula $22550\,Hz$
\end_inset

 is found sufficient for unsteady visualizations of the cove vortex evolution.
 A total spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.016\,m$
\end_inset

 are recorded around the span-center plane from a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2\,m$
\end_inset

 of spanwise length of the simulation.
 The recordings are saved in 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 sets along with the spanwise length to enable faster post-processing also.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Post-processing - The folder `postproc' contains, for each of the simulated
 case, data files related to post-processing of the data.
 The post-processed data primarily has visualizations for the mean flow
 recordings, vorticity, and wall pressure coefficients.
 A slice of the mean recording in the cove region at center-span plane is
 also available as MeanData.csv.
 This recording is used for obtaining streamlines and the shear layer shape.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All simulations that is a part of results in thesis are given in the Table.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:allcases"

\end_inset

.
 The variables are Angle of Attack (AOA), Slat Deflection Angle (SDA), Slat
 Gap (SGP) and Slat Overlap (SOL).
 All angles are in degrees and lengths in mm.
 A total of 33 cases are documented of which the first case is the reference
 case studied in Chapter 04.
 This corresponds to the default slat positioning with respect to the airfoil
 and the coordinates are obtained from geometry available from the original
 VALIANT project
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The first three cases are the result of simulations that varied only the
 slat gap progressively.
 Among simulation 4 to 32, 10 are selected using the Latin Hypercube with
 Multi-dimensional uniformity to enable initial exploration of parameter
 space and 18 are run using the Bayesian Active Learning sampling technique.

.
 The shear layer shape varies with respect to the position of the slat.
 The most sensitive variable to the shape is the Slat Overlap.
 As the slat overlap is negative by definition if the slat trailing edge
 is upstream of the leading edge of the main element, the value needs to
 decrease to increase slats proximity to the main element.
 As it is increased, the shear layer readjusts such that the flow has to
 reverse its direction progressively in order to circumvent the main element's
 leading edge.
 This introduces a strong reversal of curvature to the shear layer.
 The initial curvature is also affected such that when slat overlap is decreased
, i.e.
 slat move closed to the main element, the initial shear layer from the
 slat cusp takes a more tangential path to the free stream flow, only to
 reverse its direction strongly.
 As the flow is more tangential to the incoming flow below the slat cusp,
 the initial curvature of the shear layer decreases leading to less instability
 effects due to curvature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, when the slat overlap is decreased, i.e.
 the slat move further away from the main element, the cove recirculation
 shape converges such that the shear layer has a regularized curvature distribut
ion.
 This can be noticed for Case 22, which is the most noisy case among the
 dataset and the coordinates are close to the standard configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible to have configurations whose initial curvatures are
 excessively high by maintaining a high slat gap and a positive slat overlap.
 In such cases like Case 5, for example, the flow is strongly deviated towards
 the trailing edge from the initial shear layer instead of having a tangential
 flow.
 Such cases however also tend to have an early impingement with a significantly
 small recirculation region if the slat overlap is too high.

 All computations follow the same parameters as explained in Chapter 03
 and 04.
 Case 22 has the strongest broadband and tonal components and since it is
 closest to the experimental case, this case is chosen as the basis of compariso
n.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For cases which are close to Case 22, the broadband and tonal noise are
 largely significant.
 Cases where the slat gap and overlap are suited, the tonal frequency also
 shows changes in the selection of frequency selection.
 The first four tones are shown to have a high degree of correlation in
 their variation with respect to the slat position.
 The fifth tone however maintain a stable frequency and can be present even
 in the absence of other tones.

\begin_layout Standard
The shear layer curvature profiles are given in Fig.

\end_inset

.
 The curvatures are computed along the mean shear layer and for a streamline
 whose origin near the cusp is chosen as detailed in Chapter 04.
 The curvature is calculated as the geometric curvature of the streamline
 and for the mid-span plane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curvature inflection point can be noted as the location of local drop
 in the curvature magnitude for each case.
 The location of impingement is marked by the second sharp peak after this
 inflection.
 For most cases, the curvature calculation after impingement location accrues
 a strong numerical noise.
 This is due to the low convergence of the flow features due to low frequency
 oscillating components in the flow leading to non-smoothness of the streamline
 calculation from the averaged velocity field.
 Case 22 which serves as the most noisy case is included for all plots to
 enable comparison.

Spanwise Cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spanwise modulation of spanwise velocity is visualized using 3D isocontours
 for spanwise velocity.
 These cells vary according to the shear layer shape and recirculation cavity
 shape.
 The same for all cases int he dataset are shown in in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 As can be noted, the formation of cells and their cell size is dependent
 on the cove recirculation shape driven by the slat positioning.
 The presence of the shapes is also seen to be dependent on the cases where
 there exists cases with no spanwise cell formation, cases with 3, 4, and
 5 cells in total across the span.
 This also serves to bolster the notion that formation of the spanwise cells
 is not an artifact of the spanwise periodic condition but a physical manifestat
ion of the centrifugal instability of the flow inside the cove recirculation.

Spanwise Variation of Spanwise-Velocity Spectra
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spanwise spectra of spanwise component of velocity near the slat cusp
 revealed a low frequency localized oscillation at the diverging planes.
 These oscillations were shown to be restricted to the vicinity of diverging
 planes in Chapter 04.
 The same was also shown to correspond to the recirculation frequency based
 on the low speed recirculation velocity inside the cove in Chapter 06.
 To demonstrate that this oscillation is a consistent feature across cases
 with consistency of the low frequency at around 200Hz, the spanwise variation
 of the spectra with appropriate color scale is shown in Fig.

High-Lift Devices (HLDs) were conceived and tested as an apparatus to improve
 airplane lift performance as early as the 1940s

.
 They primarily enabled aircrafts to take off from shorter runways as in
 the case of military requirements and as the jet engine designs were adapted
 for high-speed cruise, the high-lift wings became necessary to enable take
 offs and landings with heavy payloads.
 HLDs also delayed the stall of the airfoil as well as reduced the required
 angle of attack during take-off allowing better flight controls and enhanced
 visibility over the main-body leading edge.
 The aeroacoustics of HLDs became an active area of research slightly later
 when the airframe noise was identified as a major contributor to aircraft
 noise
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This was an effect of the rising popularity of high-bypass turbofan engine
 designs in the 1970s implicitly leading to a sharp reduction in engine
 noise, making them comparable to noise from landing-gears and HLDs.
 The latter two, conveniently called the airframe noise, is to date the
 next engineering bottleneck towards quieter aircraft designs fit for modern
 aviation

 In light of these developments, renewed efforts in airframe noise research
 were promoted by major economies and set the target for noise reduction
 efforts by atleast -10

 This also is the fuel behind our current activity and our primary focus
 is on further detailed characterization of HLD noise sources using advanced
 computational methods.
 In this process we also develop tools which enable rapid and data-driven
 aeroacoustic characterization of such complex engineering flows attempting
 to bypass the complexity of its numerical modelling.

HLDs typically includes two additional components on a standard wing aerofoil,
 namely the leading edge slat and the trailing edge flap as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:An-Airbus-A310-300"

\end_inset

.
 Both slats and flaps are commonly deployed in tandem during take-off and
 landing and are thus active noise sources for operation near airports.
 Among them the leading edge slat cavity has been identified as the dominant
 noise source for low and mid-frequency characteristics and the trailing
 edge flap for high frequency noise respectively
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In general, a wing with HLD generate 10

.
 However a complete analysis of its noise mechanisms are hindered when it
 is part of a larger set of noise sources including the airframe cavity
 noise, landing gear noise, and installation effects.
 Hence as part of efforts to isolate behavior of HLD noise sources, standardized
 sub-scale geometries were created as part of BANC workshops
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Choudhari2012"

.
 The popular configuration is the 30P30N where the slat and flap are deflected
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $30$
\end_inset

 degrees from the main element.
 A schematic of the same is shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:geometries_30p30n-1"

\end_inset

.
 Now, although both the slats and flaps contribute significantly to the
 total noise, the mechanisms behind the mid-frequency noise generation in
 the leading edge slat cavity are particularly elusive to engineers due
 to the complex cove flow dynamics.
 Hence on further sophistication of the investigations, the slat only configurat
ion had to be isolated and studied in detail.
 For the same,

 and refer to the same as the VALIANT HLD.
 The positioning of the slat with respect to the main element in this configurat
ion, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, will be referred to as the standard geometry as well in contrast to the
 cases where we change this positioning.
 It must be emphasized that given the trailing edge of this geometry is
 not of practical relevance, and the noise associated with the same are
 also not of interest, given that there are no suspected interactions between
 this trailing edge and the cove flow dynamics via their acoustics.
 This is so far the case.
 Additionally, the removal of the trailing edge flap has an important advantage
 in enabling experimental studies.
 The 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
textcolor{red}{3 element}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 HLD by design generates a strong lift resulting in a significant deflection
 of the incoming jet while mounted in the wind tunnel.
 The deflection necessitates that the wind tunnel installations must be
 adapted to allow this deflection.
 In the 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

 case, the deflection is now reduced due to removal of the deflection by
 the flap and therefore generates less lift and less deflection.
 The wind tunnel setup is thus simplified.
 Given these features VALIANT HLD is adopted for both numerical and computationa
l campaigns at carried out at Ecole Centrale de Lyon.

The study, or in particular the reasoning on mechanisms underlying slat
 tones, is but incomplete in the literature.
 The tonal noise is largely explained based on the feedback mechanism typical
 in a cavity flow and is called the Rossiter modes
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Casalino2022"

 The flow develops strong turbulence as it encounters the pressure side
 cusp of the slat since there occurs strong shearing of flow between the
 two sides of the cusp.
 The phenomena can be explained based on Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability
 and leads to periodic shedding of vortices
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Terracol2016,Manoha2012"

 Since the mean flow after the cusp deviates from free stream to pass through
 the slat cove, the vortices are also convected through the slat gap.
 See Fig.

 for a schematic.
 The nozzle effect due to constriction between the slat and main element
 accelerates the flow and hence the vortices are also accelerated as distorted
 before ejection.
 At low angle of attacks, these accelerated vortices impinges on inner wall
 of the slat trailing edge leading to strong momentum fluctuations near
 the trailing edge.
 The flow then splits where one part enters the recirculation in the cove
 while the other part is ejected out of the slat gap.
 The impinged vortices generate acoustic waves due to momentum fluctuations
 and these waves, both the original ones and those amplified by the trailing
 edge scattering, travel back to the pressure side cusp, influencing the
 periodicity of vortex shedding at the cusp.
 Thus the periodic vortex shedding and resulting influence from acoustic
 waves due to its impingement leads to a resonant cycle in the cove region
 leading to selection of discrete frequencies and the resulting pressure
 fluctuations emanate as acoustic waves towards farfield

 Regarding the high frequency hump,

 also showed that the frequency of this hump have a high energy content
 in the PSD of ejected turbulence.
 Hence, it can be assumed that both mid-frequency and high frequency broadband
 humps are directly related to the turbulence ejection at trailing edge.
 It is worthy to note that there may exist additional high frequency tones
 in experimental data due to periodic vortex shedding at the trailing edge
 but this is not observed in flight conditions

At the current juncture of this research, it must be acknowledged that the

 has promptly underlined the importance of advanced CFD methods including
 the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) simulations.
 On par with expensive high-order schemes for Navier-Stokes equations designed
 to obtain high fidelity data of the flow dynamics, LBMs enable fast turnaround
 simulations and bring in additional features such as adaptability to complicate
d geometries using Cartesian meshes by deploying Immersed Boundary Methods
 together with a high level of parallelism

 Popular LBM solvers like PowerFLOW have also already been demonstrated

 their noise signatures

 Ecole Centrale de Lyon's partnership in the solver development as been

 Consequently, we also take maximal effort to test and validate the solver

 As for contributions from this thesis towards this development, we put

 In this perspective, reduced order models for flow and acoustics computations
 are possible by leveraging on the high-quality datasets available from
 both simulations and laboratory experiments.
 Their applications in aeroacoustics are still in its infancy and hence
 a few curious experimentation are also undertaken as part of this work.
 In particular we deploy a statistical inference method based on Bayesian
 Active Learning to enable an automated inference procedure regarding the
 nature of the far-field sound spectra with respect to the

 more than 30 high-fidelity slat noise simulations.

 to obtain new insights into the cove dynamics thereby facilitating advancement
 in the fundamental understanding of its phenomenology.

This chapter aims to review the existing literature necessary to facilitate
 the study of slat noise.
 Given that the aeroacoustic mechanism in slat noise is a composite of fluid
 dynamic interactions arising from its shear layer behavior, trailing edge
 scattering, and aeroacoustic resonance, and that the three are simultaneously
 active under the setting of a cavity flow, we start by presenting these
 fundamental processes separately before presenting the actual slat noise
 literature.
 Thanks to the very recent revitalization of research interest in aeroacoustics,
 many of these topics have been thoroughly reviewed on their historic context
 and developments to until as late as the previous year.
 Hence we do not reproduce such extensive versions here but only present
 their summaries with a perspective pertinent to our intended study.

 The resulting fluctuations in the immediate vicinity of a sharp trailing
 edge are then scattered by the edge and results in a dipole like source
 centered at the edge.
 Although a debated topic, this effect was suggested to be largely independent
 of the unsteady Kutta condition except for high frequency noise and non-linear
 effects in the directivities

 Compared to the noise of free turbulence which scales with 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{8}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $M^{6}$
\end_inset

, the trailing edge scattering serves as a dominant mechanism when flow
 speeds are sufficiently low.

For the intensity of the farfield noise, the trailing edge scattering efficiency
 is dependent on the spanwise coherence length
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cavalieri2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is due to the fact that when the structures are spanwise oriented
 – with respect to the largely two dimensional flow – the input pressure
 fluctuations at the TE will also be coherent along the spanwise edge length
 leading to their strong radiation by scattering.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, if the distance between the passing eddy and the TE is increased such
 that the Helmholtz number 
\begin_inset Formula $k\bar{r_{0}}\gg1$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{r_{0}}$
\end_inset

 is the distance of the passing eddy from the edge and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the wavenumber of the radiated acoustic wave of interest, the trailing
 edge noise efficiency decreases.
 But within the proximity of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\bar{r_{0}}<0.5$
\end_inset

, the noise level increases by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $k\bar{r_{0}}^{-3}$
\end_inset

.
 This partially can be attributed to the effective coherence of the incident
 fluctuations which also is inversely proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{r_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The incident fluctuations at the trailing edge can thus be used as the input
 to model far-field TE noise as in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Amiet1976"

\end_inset

.
 His model uses the pressure fluctuations at a location slightly upstream
 of the trailing edge together with an infinite chord assumption.
 This then by the Schwarzchild technique for the wave equation of the acoustic
 potential enables calculating the pressure variation across the sharp trailing
 edge which then act as a distribution of acoustic sources at the TE.
 Then the radiation can be propagated to the farfield by calculating noise
 using the canonical Green's function.
 This method thus provides a physically valid method of calculation of the
 TE scattering phenomena and also validated the theory.
 An extension to the TE noise theory for engineering application was also
 given by

 studied the data from large eddy simulation and used Spectral Proper Orthogonal
 Decomposition (SPOD) to isolate the dominant structures that are responsible
 for the pressure fluctuations at the trailing edge.
 Their analysis suggested that the largest eigen value modes represented
 most part of the acoustic energy.
 The corresponding modes were also shown to have an extended structure spanning
 from the location of boundary layer detachment to the trailing edge.
 They hence suggested that the trailing edge noise is related to non-compact
 source fluctuations.
 They also suggested that the phase of the fluctuations also have an impact
 such that the maximum source efficiency occurs when the incoming perturbations
 are out of phase between the suction side and the pressure side.

Airfoil self-noise refers to the noise generated by a single element airfoil
 due to interactions with the turbulence developing along its surface
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The primary source of turbulence here is the boundary layer turbulence
 generated by the boundary layer flow over the walls.
 For subsonic speeds, the major noise source mechanism is the above mentioned
 TBL-TE noise phenomenon and contributes to a broadband noise in the farfield.
\end_layout

Apart from the TE phenomena another major noise mechanism occurs when the
 airfoil is stalled
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Moreau2009"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 When it happens that the flow on the suction side of the airfoil separates
 prematurely, before reaching the trailing edge, large scale vortex structures
 are shed from the suction side of the airfoil, leading to strong generation
 of turbulence.
 In a mildly separated flow, the noise mechanism will stay similar to the
 trailing edge radiation but due to stronger incoming vorticity at TE.
 Hence a broadband increase by about 10 dBdB over TBL-TE

\color black
.
 As the angle of attack increases, the flow separation point moves towards
 the leading edge and the noise progressively shifts to a lower frequency
 range.

\color inherit
 During deep stall, the airfoil operates as a bluff body and the noise is
 generated from the full surface of the chord and the low frequency component
 are diminished together with the development of narrow band peaks in 
\color black
same Strouhal range
\color inherit
.
 These are attributed to the periodic shedding of large scale vortices and
 their interaction with the leading and trailing edges
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Laratro2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The sharpness of transition from mild stall noise to deep stall noise is
 also determined by the thickness of the airfoil.
 The stall noise is a dominant component of the total noise when present
 but however is less prevalent in high-lift applications.
 It is so since the high-lift device (HLD) primarily delays the stall on
 the main body, i.e.
 an HLD allows the airfoil to operate at a higher angles of attack without
 initiating stall due to the secondary turbulent flow generated by the leading
 edge slat.
 The large scale periodic vortex shedding from the suction side wall on
 an airfoil is hence replaced by the reattachment of a periodically oscillating
 shear layer from the slat trailing edge for the HLD.
 The only related possible mechanism in HLDs is thus of a mild-stall condition
 on its main element with strongly turbulent inflow conditions due to presence
 of upstream cove flow.
 This can potentially explain mid-frequency broadband components.

A third noise mechanism for airfoils arise from the vortex shedding from

 were the early experimenters to show that an airfoil placed in a uniform
 laminar flow generated broadband noise with dominant tonal components and
 the tone frequencies followed a ladder-type evolution with the flow velocity.
 The laminar boundary layers at low Reynolds numbers without pressure gradients
 are stable according to the Rayleigh criteria.
 However, any slight incoming perturbation can excite the boundary layer
 (BL) instabilities.
 The most unstable modes in a viscous laminar parallel flat 2D BL flow are
 known as the Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lowson1994"

.
 These pressure and velocity perturbations, when excited at a source location
 on the airfoil surface by external factors, grow along the streamwise direction
 until their amplitude saturates non-linearly into turbulence generating
 vortices which are then convected past the trailing edge
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Longhouse1977"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The trailing edge scattering then generates acoustic waves that travel
 back to the location of the T-S wave onset to enhance their excitation,
 thereby completing an aeroacoustic loop
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Vittal-shenoy2023"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This mode of resonance thus destabilizes a laminar boundary layer on an
 airfoil even when there is no adverse pressure gradient along the wall.
 Since the TS instability is receptive to a broadband range of incoming
 perturbations, the presence of the turbulent boundary layer on one side
 of the airfoil is sufficient to excite the instability on both sides, given
 the angle of attack and Reynolds numbers.
 The resulting noise spectra will also have quasi-tones related to the shedding
 rates at the trailing edge

A fourth mechanism for airfoil self-noise arises from the trailing edge
 shape.
 A blunt trailing edge can facilitate shedding of vorticity if the edge
 thickness is comparatively larger than the boundary layer thicknesses.

 The pressure fluctuations associated with the vortices shed, which form
 a von Karman street downstream of the TE, are scattered by the edges resulting

This feature of a blunt trailing edge tonal noise is important for slat
 aeroacoustics.
 The trailing edge of the slat geometry in the reference configuration of
 VALIANT, introduced in the previous chapter, has a thickness of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\,mm$
\end_inset

.
 The peak velocity of the ejected flow from the slat gap rises to approximately
 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 times the ambient speed and hence a velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,m/s$
\end_inset

 can be taken an an estimate.
 Consequently the resulting trailing edge shedding frequency will be around
 
\begin_inset Formula $20\,kHz$
\end_inset

 and hence can explain the high frequency hump typical for slat noise spectra.
 However, as shown by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Roger2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the coherence of the eddies along the slat trailing edge will be an important
 factor determining the source efficiency.
 In the slat cove flow, this source will hence be weakened by the vorticity
 dynamics in the cove which favors a disintegration of the spanwise coherent
 vorticity from the cusp while being convected towards the trailing edge.
 Moreover, given that for the high speed ejection at the slat gap, the vortex
 shedding noise is at the very high frequency range of 
\begin_inset Formula $20 kHzkHz$
\end_inset

, it does not interact directly with the characteristic resonance mechanisms
 that occur at much lower frequencies.

Cavity noise is another fundamental phenomenon of aeroacoustics which is
 of importance for the slat noise.
 The recent view of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, presents most of the significant developments.
 The canonical cavity flow addressed in fluid dynamics is a regular shaped
 rectangular cavity under a grazing flow, where a turbulent shear layer
 develops over the open side.
 The shear layer at the upstream edge of the open side develops the canonical
 K-H instability and leads to vortex shedding.
 These vortices then impinge on the downstream edge of the cavity leading
 to partial convection of the flow past the edge and partial recirculation
 of the reminiscent flow within the volume of the cavity.
 The resulting oscillatory motion at the slat trailing edge leads to periodic
 variations of the static pressure inside the cavity which then leads to
 periodic oscillation of the shear layer itself.
 The perturbations that reach back to the leading edge then provide the
 trigger for the K-H instability.
 The combination of vortex shedding and acoustic waves form and aeroacoustic
 feedback loop that leads to the formation and impingement of strongly coherent
 large vorticity structures thereby generating acoustic waves at the frequency
 corresponding to the acoustic wave propagation time.
 These oscillations were understood early on by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Strouhal1878"

\end_inset

 to be primarily determined by the incoming velocity and associated length
 scales which led him to formulate the non-dimensional characteristic frequency
 referred to as the Strouhal number.
 The shear layer oscillations and the impinging vortices were theorized
 and studied later as an aeroacoustic resonance by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Rossiter1964"

 where he demonstrated, using shadowgraphs, that the regular impingement
 of vortices at the trailing edge and their time of shedding were synchronized,
 resulting in amplification of the pressure perturbations.

The flow dynamics developed in a cavity is largely dependent on the geometric
 proportions of the cavity.
 For the rectangular shape, the streamwise flow types are generally categorized
 into open and closed

 The configuration is referred to as open if the streamwise length to depth

\end_inset

 is less than 5 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 In this configuration the shear layer reattaches the downstream of the
 trailing edge and hence causes large shear layer oscillations to occur
 which are excited by the internal recirculation.
 Both deep cavity tones are produced together with Rossiter modes in this
 case.
 On the contrary, the flow is treated as closed when 
\begin_inset Formula $L/D>12$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the streamwise length of the cavity is sufficiently high
 such that shear layer from the leading edge curves inwards to reattach
 with the cavity floor before separating again at upstream of the trailing
 edge.
 This case hence produces significant drag due to the stagnation of the
 flow inside the cavity

It is between these two extremes that the cavity flow is called transitional.
 When closer to the open configuration with 
\begin_inset Formula $5<L/D<7$
\end_inset

, the flow is predominantly open with the shear layer impinging at close
 proximity to the trailing edge.
 The flow often transition here between a closed mode or open mode depending
 on the incoming flow velocities.
 The transition here is also affected by the development of the flow in
 the third dimension which depend on

The three dimensionality in cavity flows, as will be shown later, is an
 important aspect to understand the slat cove flow.
 In the rectangular cavity configuration, the cavity is referred to as wide
 
\begin_inset Formula $2D$
\end_inset

, if the width of the cavity is sufficiently high, typically 
\begin_inset Formula $L/W<<1$
\end_inset

.
 This is also the case of an spanwise infinite flow where the spanwise features
 of the flow dynamics are dispersed into the infinite domain.
 In contrast, for the case referred to as the Narrow 
\begin_inset Formula $3D$
\end_inset

 case, the spanwise width is limited by the presence of a wall constraining
 the domain such that 
\begin_inset Formula $L/W>1$
\end_inset

.
 In this case the three dimensional dynamics are retained locally within
 the flow resulting in their influence on the larger 
\begin_inset Formula $2D$
\end_inset

 flow.
 This is often the scenario if experimental investigation of the slat noise
 is carried out in a wind tunnel where the spanwise spacing of the lateral
 supporting plates is not sufficiently large.

 However, note that this comparison is widely inaccurate on the details
 since for a rectangular cavity, the cavity shape is a regular rectangle
 whereas in the cove flow, the cavity has the shape of the inner slat wall,
 which itself approximates as circular.
 More importantly, the shear layer in an open cavity flow bridges the open
 side in a dominantly linear path.
 In contrast the slat cove shear layer undergoes a curved path whose curvature
 itself lies in the linearly unstable regime.
 This is one perspective that we wish to study and to highlight to the community
 through our work.

Curved Shear Layer

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A last but substantial of flow phenomena that we believe is necessary to
 understand slat cove dynamics is that of the curved shear layer.
 This is because the argument that the slat cove is spanwise homogeneous
 is the accepted notion among slat noise researchers thereby instructing
 the experiments to overlook spanwise variations.
 The fact is that in perspective of the cavity flow phenomena, the slat
 cove flow is a wide flow with an equivalent length to depth ratio larger
 than 1.
 However, the key difference here lies, according to our understanding,
 is that the shear layer in slate cove has a strongly curved trajectory
 with a slat chord based non-dimensional radius of curvature of 
\begin_inset Formula $R/C_{s}<0.5$

 Historically, in the very early developments on slat related noise studies,

 noted that its broadband noise contributes as high as 11 dBdB to the Overall

 This component which was observed in the flight data did not have specific
 tones.
 Consequently, the early slat noise model for flight conditions by

 also focused on modelling the broadband component and followed the hypothesis
 that the trailing edge noise mechanism is dominant.

 In these experiments, the high lift devices were found to have narrow band
 tones in addition to the broadband spectra.

 first hypothesized that these tones can originate from the vortex shedding
 of the blunt trailing edge but later reported that attempts to directly
 correlate the vortex shedding frequency to the thickness of the blunt trailing
 edge were not successful.
 Subsequently efforts were made to correlate the tone frequencies with the
 boundary layer displacement thickness which also did not bear fruit

Gap tones
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and suggested that in both the slat cove and in case of jet shear layers,
 an aeroacoustic mechanism can explain the generation of acoustic tones.
 The frequency of the tones were also shown to be predictable by using only
 kinematic considerations, i.e.
 the time lag between the vortex shedding and the acoustic generation due
 to their interaction with the wall or the flow itself.
 This was the first suggestion that the slat tones could possibly be explained
 by an aeroacoustic resonance.
 Subsequent developments can be noted to be informed of both the tonal and
 broadband nature of slat noise with the broadband noise being the main
 focus for modelling flight test datasets

 and subsequently such a model was found to have reasonable agreements with
 their slat noise datasets from flight tests.
 However, in his work this correspondence of the scaling law was reported
 to be only nominal, derived from dimensional analysis, and the total slat
 noise behavior deviates to have a Mach number power dependency of 
\begin_inset Formula $5.3$

 to obtain a better agreement with observations, as first suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This also lies in between the noise efficiency of a classical trailing
 edge source (
\begin_inset Formula $M^{5}$
\end_inset

) and that of a simple airfoil in a turbulent field (
\begin_inset Formula $M^{6}$
\end_inset

) and the difference can be attributed to the propagation effects which
 is determined by the presence and complex nature of the flow on the slat-airfoi
l configuration.
 The farfield directivity of slat noise also reproduces largely a dipole
 shaped radiation centered at the trailing edge of the slat as shown in
 the work of

 They also reported that the tonal components had a Strouhal number which

 In their suggestion, this was reasoned to be an effect of the variation
 of the shear layer length where a longer vortex trajectory would cause
 a longer travel times for the eddies and thus a reduction of the resonant
 Strouhal numbers.

 The resulting formula based on kinematic considerations use the vortex
 shedding location as the slat cusp and the trailing edge as the location
 of impingement of the trailing edge.
 The travel time for the spanwise coherent vortices shed from the cusp then
 provides the major time delay and, together with the feedback time for
 the acoustic wave from the trailing edge to reach back at the cusp, it
 provides the total time period for the resonant oscillation.

 This formula assumes that the slat tones are harmonics of a fundamental

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A review of the basic phenomena related to slat noise, namely the TE noise,
 airfoil self noise, and cavity noise, are reviewed in this chapter together
 with the current state of art of leading edge slat noise.
 These phenomena in our understanding is necessary to understand the dynamics
 and noise generation in the airfoil configuration.
 With the conclusion that there are sound advancements in both analytical
 modeling of tonal noise and data-driven methods using LBM, we now choose
 the data-driven paradigm as the basis of this work.
 This aligns with our objective of obtaining a fast-turn around aeroacoustic
 prediction tool that can be used at a design engineers desk during design
 optimizations.
 For this, we deploy the commercial LBM solver ProLB, together with a Ffowcs
 Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy method to develop an acoustic prediction
 framework.
 The data is first used to investigate the slat noise phenomena in relation
 to the above mentioned basic mechanisms of noise generation and then to
 put forward a data-driven framework that enables to bypass the expensive
 LBM or acoustic analogy methods to obtain a noise estimate.
 This latter choice is primarily motivated by the aim is to develop a slat
 noise prediction framework that is agnostic to the geometrical complexities.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first objective of this thesis is to concoct a suitable framework that
 will enable the investigation of slat noise phenomena numerically.
 Due to the inherent complexity of accelerated shear flow along the curved
 path through slat gap and the impingement of the flow past the sharp edges
 of both the slat cusp and the trailing edge, the flow itself necessitates
 a high-fidelity simulation that can capture unsteady evolution of shear
 layer and its dynamic interactions.
 The three dimensional aspect of flow has also not been investigated in
 detail so far although the flow features are acknowledged to have strong
 three dimensionality from early studies
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Khorrami2006,Choudhari2007,Manoha2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is due to the fact that the spanwise homogeneity is assumed to be
 sufficient in explaining the major phenomena of the 2D shear layer evolution
 and related Rossiter mechanism
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "HamiltonSmith2024"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the observed far-field sound clearly suggests that there can be
 unexplored mechanisms arising possibly from the three dimensionality underlying
 the stochastic nature of its tones
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Jawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, any estimation of the farfield sound using time-averaged computation
 of the flow will also introduce modelling errors that will prevent a deeper
 investigation of the flow dynamics.
 Hence our first choice is to obtain a three-dimensional compressible unsteady
 simulation framework that will enable direct simulation of the source mechanism
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A detailed investigation of flow and acoustics within the slat cavity will
 also need a parametric variation of the slat positioning.
 Since the vortices from the shear layer and their evolution along their
 trajectory in the cove plays the major role in the acoustic generation
 mechanism
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Terracol2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, variation of the shear layer shape with respect to the slat positioning
 has to be documented in order to form a deeper understanding.
 To enable this, the first difficulty is in generating meshes inside the
 cove geometry.
 The mesh has to be adapted in case of parametric slat positions and hence
 an extensive exploration is not possible unless automatic mesh generation
 is enabled.
 Additionally, the noise generation in the slat cove needs to be captured
 with high fidelity in all cases computed and needs to be propagated without
 numerical loss and artifacts to a far-field observer.
 This requires that the mesh choices must enable accurate source modelling
 together with wave propagation with low numerical dissipation and dispersion,
 and at minimal computational cost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among a few advanced techniques in modern CFD, this case thus falls under
 the scope of a wall-modelled Large Eddy Simulation (WMLES).
 It utilities a wall-modeling approach for the boundary layer near the walls
 and deploys a well resolved mesh that can capture the scales of interest
 for the slat cove while modelling the sub-grid scale behaviors.
 This has been shown to be an effective approach for detailed investigation
 of slat noise for a select geometrical configuration, and complicated meshing
 procedures were surmounted by manual effort
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Choudhari2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is also the same scenario if a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) has
 to be deployed but only with much larger computational costs which, however,
 will provide the same level of fidelity regarding the noise phenomena
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Moreau2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Hence the canonical wall-resolved LES and DNS are not viable in our study
 which aims to obtain an extensive dataset by variation of slat position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more advanced technique has been deployed in the recent years which uses
 the Lattice Boltzmann framework to obtain an equivalent WMLES.
 It has been demonstrated that this method sufficiently captures the noise
 mechanisms and the propagation effects.
 Here a Very Large Eddy Simulations (VLES) were introduced for slat noise
 simulations by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Satti2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and was taken further into high-fidelity simulations in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 They deployed the commercial Lattice Boltzmann software PowerFLOW to demonstrat
e that this class of simulations indeed enabled simulations of the slat
 noise phenomena to a high level of accuracy.
 These LBM frameworks natively uses a Cartesian mesh necessitated by the
 voxel based discretisation together with an Immersed Boundary model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Astoul2021,Feng2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Using this technique, the wall geometry is placed in a volume discretized
 using cubic elements and the wall model is used to estimate the conditions
 at the first cell.
 With a sufficient resolution specified to the region near the boundary,
 the meshing procedure is thus fully automated while varying the slat positions.
 This enables to eliminate inconsistencies arising from the manual meshing
 of the geometries and allows a coherent analysis.
 Another factor that advocates for the LBM approach for aeroacoustics is
 its low numerical and dissipation characteristics.
 The LBM formalism implicitly generates a scheme which has a low numerical
 dissipation and can be finely controlled using its modelling parameters.
 This enables accurate propagation of the generated acoustics to far-field
 observer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence the expedited meshing procedure and low numerical dissipation characterist
ics of LBM places the same as a niche technique to be useful in a detailed
 study of slat aeroacoustics.
 It was thus chosen for the progress of our work.
 We now look into a detailed view of the LBM framework for its theoretical
 developments before delineating the methods that we use to adapt a commercial
 LBM software

ProLB

 for our slat noise investigation.

\begin_layout Standard
The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) arises from the fundamental idea of a
 Lattice Gas Automata, where behavior of a fluid medium is modeled as a
 cellular automation at the kinetic level
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Frisch1986"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this perspective, the fluid consist of particles – not exactly the physical
 idea of molecules, which would have been called a molecular level description
 of the fluid – that can interact with each other to exchange momentum such
 that their aggregate behavior is consistent with the kinetic theory of
 gases
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Feng2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This intermediate scale of momentum interactions are referred to as the
 mesoscopic scale and is the domain where LBM is formulated.
 The fluidic behavior is then modeled on a discrete lattice in space by
 time-stepping the properties of the lattices depending on its current state
 and the state of its immediate neighbors.
 This means that by a suitable choice of the state variables and a physically
 consistent model for interaction of the cells, the macroscopic behavior
 of a fluid medium can be simulated.
 Since evolution of each lattice is driven by its own state and those of
 its immediate neighbors, the heaviest calculations are local and the method
 can be designed to be massively parallel with limited overhead due to transfer
 of data between parallel processors
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This resonates well with the burgeoning of high-performance computing architect
ures and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) available in modern scientific
 computing especially in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
 in application to High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) simulation of turbulence.
 Its applications are hence growing in a wide range of topics including
 aeronautics research, multi-phase flows, and medical

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For simulating a fluid using LBM, the first assumption is that the fluid
 behavior can be modeled using probability density functions representing
 the discretized particle velocity vector.
 This means that the velocity of the fictitious particles are discretized
 in terms of its directions from the center node of a lattice to each of
 its nodes, and each of the component is not represented as a deterministic
 quantity but rather by means of a probability density distribution.
 Each of these velocity directions then aids as a channel of interaction
 of the particles between one lattice and its neighbors.
 Given that these velocities are represented by PDFs, the statistical moments
 of these PDFs can be shown to be the equivalent of the density and momentum
 of the macroscopic fluid particles represented by groups of such particles.
\end_layout

Looking at it more formally, the total number of particles in a fluidic
 medium located at a position 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 with a microscopic particle velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 at a time instant 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
dN=f_{N}(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\xi},t)\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{x}\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\xi}

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{N}(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\xi},$
\end_inset

t) denotes the particle density probability distribution as a function of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{x}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\xi}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $dx$
\end_inset

 is a mesoscopic spatial volume around the position 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{x}$
\end_inset

.
 If the particles have identical mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, then the mass density distribution becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $mf_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 Using such a probability density function, the local fluid density can
 be represented as its zeroth order statistical moment.
 Similarly the higher order moments lead to momentum density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\mathbf{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
\end_inset

 and total energy density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho E(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
\end_inset

.
 These can be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}f(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\xi},t)\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\xi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho\mathbf{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}\boldsymbol{\xi}f(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\xi},t)\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\xi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho E(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}\frac{|\boldsymbol{\xi}|^{2}}{2}f(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\xi},t)\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\xi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The total energy of a kinetic gas, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho E(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
\end_inset

, is the sum of its internal energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho e(\boldsymbol{x},t)$
\end_inset

, and its kinetic energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\rho|\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t)|^{2}$
\end_inset

 , and the former is linked to the variance of the velocity distribution
 providing the formula for the thermodynamic temperature of the fluid as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\frac{e(\boldsymbol{x},t)}{c_{v}}=\frac{1}{\rho c_{v}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}\frac{|\boldsymbol{\xi}-\boldsymbol{u}|^{2}}{2}f(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\xi},t)\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\xi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{v}$
\end_inset

 is the isochoric specific heat capacity.
 The fluid pressure can now be obtained from the perfect gas law as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\rho(\boldsymbol{x},t)r_{g}T(\boldsymbol{x},t)
\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $r_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the thermodynamic gas constant in accordance with the kinetic theory
 of gases.
 The discrete particle velocity distribution function in a lattice is hence
 sufficient to retrieve the macroscopic quantities of the fluid.
 The interaction of the particle velocity distribution function, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, between the lattices needs to be modeled in such a way that the macroscopic
 fluid behavior is in accordance with the Navier-Stokes equations.
 This is achieved by utilizing the Boltzmann equation and the collision
 operator therein.
 The Boltzmann equation itself determining the time evolution of the particle
 distribution function is written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\boldsymbol{\xi}\cdot\frac{\partial f}{\partial\boldsymbol{x}}=\Omega(f)\label{eq:boltzmann_eqn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, the left hand side is a convection equation for the particle velocity
 distribution whereas the right hand term 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(f)$
\end_inset

, the collision operator, is the term driving the convection of these probabilit
ies.
 On constraining the collision process model such that the mass, momentum,
 and total energy, of the fluid is conserved during such a process, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bhatnagar1954"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 showed that the primal effect of the collision operator is to shift the
 state of particle velocity distribution to that of the thermodynamic equilibriu
m of the fluid i.e.
 the Boltzmann equation in each time step operates on the particle velocity
 distribution to relax it towards the thermodynamic equilibrium.
 A linearisation of the collision operator was made possible by simplifying
 the collision process as a direct and simpler form of `relaxation' of a
 given particle density function to its thermodynamic equilibrium.
 This relaxation step using a single timestep for the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook
 (BGK) model writes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Omega^{BGK}(\mathbf{x},t)=-\frac{1}{\tau}\left(f(\mathbf{x},t)-f^{(0)}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the relaxation time, and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 is the thermodynamic equilibrium distribution function given by Maxwell-Boltzma
nn distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f^{(0)}=\frac{\rho}{\left(2\pi r_{g}T\right)^{D/2}}\exp\left(-\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\xi}-\boldsymbol{u}\|^{2}}{2r_{g}T}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As such, such an equilibrium function depends on the local density, temperature,
 and the macroscopic velocity.
 The equilibrium function can hence be computed based on the current local
 state of the particle distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, but however not completely.
 On analyzing 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, it can be obtained that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}f^{(0)}\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\xi}=\rho(\boldsymbol{x},t)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}\boldsymbol{\xi}f^{(0)}\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\xi}=\rho\mathbf{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{D}}|\boldsymbol{\xi}|^{2}f^{(0)}\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{\xi}=\rho E(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\frac{D}{2}\rho r_{g}T(\boldsymbol{x},t)+\frac{1}{2}\rho|\boldsymbol{u}(\boldsymbol{x},t)|^{2}\label{eq:traceeqn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
i.e.
 zeroth order moment, first order moment, and the trace of the second order
 moments, of the equilibrium distributions are exactly the same as that
 of the local particle velocity distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 However, only the trace of the latter, i.e.
 the total energy obeys this conformity as written in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The deviatoric part of the energy tensor, linked to the internal energy,
 and subsequently all higher order moments of the equilibrium distribution
 are not accurately recoverable from the local particle velocity distribution
 only.
 This means that an approximation of the equilibrium distribution based
 solely on the non-equilibrium distribution will introduce an error to the
 deviatoric part of the energy equation, although the total energy conservation
 will still be valid.
 This necessitates a modelling approach in such a way that a model for the
 equilibrium distribution will enable exact recovery of the full Navier-Stokes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a step towards the formalism to approximate the equilibrium distribution
 based solely on the current particle distribution function, Hilbert introduced
 an asymptotic expansion of the latter around the former, i.e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f=f^{(0)}+\epsilon f^{(1)}+\epsilon^{2}f^{(2)}+\ldots=\sum_{k=0}^{k=\infty}\epsilon^{k}f^{(k)}\label{eq:asymptoticexp}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 denotes the Knudsen number.
 The Knudsen number denotes the spatial rarity of the fluid particles and
 formally has the definition as a dimensionless number being the ratio of
 the mean free path of the particles to a characteristic length scale.
 It can typically be translated into a ratio of corresponding time scales
 as,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon=\frac{\mathcal{L}}{l_{0}}=\frac{\tau_{0}\sqrt{r_{g}T_{0}}}{l_{0}}=\frac{\tau_{0}}{t_{0}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}=\tau_{0}\sqrt{r_{g}T_{0}}$
\end_inset

 is the mean free path since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{r_{g}T_{0}}$
\end_inset

 is the isothermal sound speed at a reference temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the mean time between collisions, and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is some characteristic time of the flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapman and Enskog independently developed this approximation further under
 the constraint that the particle distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 depends solely on the macroscopic moments.
 They also proposed an expansion of the time derivative based on the order
 of Knudsen number, written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}=\sum_{k=0}^{k=\infty}\epsilon^{k}\frac{\partial}{\partial t^{(k)}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that an approximate relation between the non-equilibrium and equilibrium
 distribution is available, it is possible to analyze the behavior of the
 Lattice Boltzmann Equation in its fidelity to the Navier-Stokes behavior.

.
 We omit the actual algebra here further for sake of brevity.
 The zeroth, first, and second order moments, of the resulting equation
 will then correspond to the mass continuity, momentum conservation, and
 the energy equations, respectively.
 Here, different choices of the truncation of the expansion of equilibrium
 distribution based on the order for Knudsen number leads to different set
 of equations.
 When the expansion is truncated after first order for the Knudsen number,
 the exact Navier-Stokes equations can be retrieved.
 If only the expansion is truncated at zeroth order of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, the inviscid Euler equation is obtained.
 Hence at low Knudsen number, typically 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon<10^{-2}$
\end_inset

, which is true for widely most cases of practical application including
 aeronautics and aeroacoustics, the Boltzmann equation retrieves the Navier-Stok
es behavior while using the BGK collision model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, in order to recover the Navier-Stokes behavior, it is necessary
 to use the expansion of the non-equilibrium distribution upto first order
 in Knudsen number.
 Then to obtain the energy equation, the second order moment of the equation
 needs to be recovered which means that the first order moment of the non-equili
brium distribution and the fourth order moment of the equilibrium distribution
 will be necessary.
 Moments of the particle velocity distribution are typically computed using
 numerical quadratures in order to obtain the exact integral.
 
\color black
Here typically, LBM utilizes the Gauss-Hermite quadratures for this purpose.
 Hence, since a fourth order moment of the equilibrium distribution has
 to be computed using the Gauss-Hermite quadrature over the discrete space
 of the particle velocity vector, this will impose conditions for sufficient
 discretisation of the velocity vector in a lattice.
 In the language of Gauss-Hermite quadrature, to obtain exact integrals
 for the fourth order moment of a distribution, a quadrature of accuracy
 of order 9 needs to be employed.
 Such quadratures require a minimum of 103 discrete velocities in a 3D lattice.
 Each discrete velocity equation will require one equation to be solved
 and hence will require 103 equations to be solved per lattice per time
 step to advance the time step alone.
 This is computationally expensive although the calculation is local and
 can hence be parallelized.
 To find a compromise and design fast-LB schemes, the heat equation in the
 Navier-Stokes is ignored assuming that the simulated case is athermal.
 In this case, only the third order moment of the equilibrium distribution
 is necessary to recover the exact formulations of the momentum equations
 alone.
 Thus from the relaxed requirement for the computation of the quadratures,
 a lower number of discrete velocities is required.
 Here the minimum number of discrete velocities is 39 for the 3D lattice
 and is more affordable than the previous case.
 A detailed comparison of the schemes and formulations can be found in the
 doctoral thesis of

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further compromise that can be made is that a reasonable error in the
 Navier-Stokes momentum equation can be tolerated.
 In this setting, the computation of moments of the equilibrium distribution
 upto second order is shown to generate an error term in the recovered momentum
 equation that is of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{\mathcal{O}\left(M^{3}\right)}.$
\end_inset

 Second order moments can be calculated on a 3D lattice using the Gauss-Hermite
 quadratures using a minimum of 19 discrete velocities and results in a
 quadrature with an order of accuracy of 5.
 This leads to the most popular lattice used in the LBM solvers, namely
 the D3Q19, and also to the hydrodynamic limits for the computation using
 fast LBM solvers as for those with low Mach numbers, typically

The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is an increasingly popular alternative
 to solving the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid simulations that uses
 a mesoscopic description for the fluid's behavior.
 The fluid particle behavior is modeled using probability density functions
 representing the discretized particle velocity vector, together with an
 appropriate collision model to capture their interaction behavior.
 On rigorous analysis using suitable collision models, the exact compressible
 Navier-Stokes equations can be recovered from the Boltzmann equation.
 Nevertheless, truncation errors arising from the approximations of the
 equilibrium distributions limits its fidelity and hence fast LB schemes
 including

 studied in detail the wave dispersion and dissipation of LBM schemes in
 comparison with canonical schemes used for isothermal Navier-Stokes equation.
 Their work suggested that lattice Boltzmann schemes, which including the
 Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) and Multi-Relaxation Time (MRT) collision models,
 have better dissipation performance when compared to high-order discretisation
 schemes typically used for Navier-Stokes, i.e.
 for

 the fluidic medium using a discrete mesh.
 LBM schemes better preserve the wave energy across the discretised medium
 than Navier-Stokes solvers for a comparable grid size.
 In this regard, LBM models with the MRT scheme were also shown to be more
 dissipative than with the BGK model.
 Conversely, LBM schemes experience a larger dispersion.
 In their work, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 compared the dispersion performance of LBM schemes to that of a second
 order finite difference scheme with a 3-step Runge-Kutta algorithm.
 However, the degree of parallelism and the speed of calculation enabled
 by LBM schemes are higher than high-order schemes for a given dispersion
 error.
 Moreover, with their lower dissipation, LBM schemes are much more stable
 than Navier-Stokes solvers with high order optimized schemes.
 These properties related to wave propagation makes LBM-CFD a prudent choice
 for aeroacoustic applications

\begin_layout Standard
That being said, to use LBM for practical applications involving complex
 geometries, one bottleneck to overcome is the high number of nodes driven
 by the shape constraint of the lattice.
 In LBM, the lattices are so far required to have an aspect ratio of 1 to
 maintain integrity of its theoretical guarantees.
 This means that to resolve the boundary layer of the fluid over a given
 solid wall surface, the near wall cells also needs to be cubical.
 In conventional CFD, the near wall elements are made to have a very high
 aspect ratio such that the resolution in the normal direction to the wall
 is sufficiently high, while that parallel to the wall is maintained low,
 enabling a significant reduction of the total number of nodes in the mesh.
 The assumptions of the boundary layer allow this geometric shortcut without
 reducing the fidelity of the simulation as well.
 However this method cannot be utilized in the LBM simulations and in cases
 where the boundary layer behavior are important, the number of nodes in
 the simulation grows rapidly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a limitation introduces the requirement of mesh coarsening in practical
 LBM solvers much like in conventional solvers.
 The strategy is to contain the region of high resolution close to the wall
 geometry and to allow the mesh to be coarsened depending on the distance.
 In LBM, this coarsening is done by a factor of 2 in each direction where
 a larger mesh cell adjacent to a finer cell will have twice the side length,
 thus maintaining the cubic shape in both blocks.
 The cell nodes that are adjacent can be made to be congruent at the coarsening
 interface or an interpolation scheme can be used to use hanging nodes,
 which would be placed on a cell edge rather than being a common node between
 the cells.
 The latter introduces more flexibility but introduces an additional source
 of error due to the accuracy for the interpolations.
 In the solver used for our work, 
\series bold
\shape italic
ProLB, 
\series default
\shape default
the mesh coarsening technique used is the first one, i.e.
 with common nodes between adjacent cells on either side of a coarsening
 interface.
 However, the collision model in LBM utilizes information from the adjacent
 cells in its computation.
 This means that a change in cell size introduces errors into the simulation,
 with a strong detrimental effect onto the acoustic field due to the fact
 that acoustic perturbations are of similar amplitude as the mesh coarsening
 errors.
 The problem is exacerbated by the low dissipative nature of the LBM scheme
 as spurious fluctuations propagate through the domain without being dissipated
 near its sources.
 The mesh coarsening interfaces are hence thought of as sources of 'spurious
 noise' in the language of aeroacoustics.

.
 According to their work, the problem fundamentally arises from the fact
 that the constraints applied to LBM equations to recover the hydrodynamic
 behavior is not sufficient to obtain the equilibrium distributions correspondin
g to all the elements of the discrete velocity space.
 The dynamics of the additional unconstrained degrees of freedoms are not
 directly connected to the hydrodynamic behavior through the derivation
 of Navier-Stokes from Lattice Boltzmann Equation.
 This feeds the so called non-hydrodynamic modes, or ghost modes

A second numerical test was targeted at the wall modelling behavior of the

 An LBM scheme essentially consist of voxels which are cubic mesh elements.
 Since their aspect ratio is always equal to 1, the boundary layer resolution
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{+}<5$

 require huge number of voxels and is cost prohibitive.
 Hence wall modelling approach is a necessity for affordable LBMs.
 However, the wall modelling in

 The test results show that there is an under prediction of turbulence generatio

 For the airfoil simulation cases, this means that the flow separation phenomena
 is not well captured.
 These will manifest as a deviation of the predicted Cp value distribution
 over the geometry from that of experiments.
 Nevertheless, since our flow regime of interest does not have large flow
 separations and slat noise mechanisms are not largely affected by separation
 phenomena except slight possible deviations for flow around the cusp, this
 effect is neglected with caution.

 refinements in the domain.
 Since

 Hence the sudden cell size growth introduces error in the numerical gradient
 calculations.
 With the default version of the solver available, it was found that there
 is considerable dispersion error for acoustic pulses crossing refinement
 regions.
 Various mechanisms has also been identified in the literature whereby an
 LBM scheme can produce spurious waves in the solution due to passage of
 physical and non-physical fluxes through the refinements

 Nevertheless, a variation of

 dissipation as a function of position enable us to characterize the wave
 propagation performance of our LBM solver and thereby choose a sufficient
 simulation parameter setting, particularly the required mesh resolutions

The Gaussian pulse propagated for the simulation should contain the frequencies
 of interest, i.e.
 the bandwidth of the signal should be at least 10 kHz in frequency or 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{4}/343=30m^{-1}$
\end_inset

 in the spatial wavenumber domain.
 This is adjusted by choosing a sufficiently small pulse width.
 Here the Fourier bandwidth of a Gaussian pulse varies inversely as pulse
 width with bandwidth of a Dirac Delta function being infinite.
 The selected pulse in spatial domain is plotted in Fig.

 The wave propagation and its numerical effects are linear in the frequency
 domain – being captured by the linearized Navier-Stokes – and hence the
 behavior of the pulse in the frequency domain is an adequate indicator
 of the LBM code response for each of its Fourier components.
 Thus the same for acoustic waves in an actual simulation when linear acoustics
 are considered to be dominant.

The numerical dissipation coefficient is a function of the frequency or
 the wave number and higher frequencies suffer higher dissipation.
 The inverse is true for dispersion where the higher wave number components
 suffer more from a loss of phase speed.
 Variation of the pulse in the frequency domain as it propagates through
 the mesh illustrates this and is shown in Figure

 As expected, the obtained values follow the trend as described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Nevertheless, for the 
\emph on
ProLB
\emph default
  result, the slight amplification of the mid-high frequencies are also
 notable as the negative value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{S}^{num}$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the waves of these frequencies will show a growth in amplitude
 during the propagation and those at higher frequencies will dissipate,
 both effects amplified when the mesh is coarsened.
 However, we do not notice such growth of amplitude leading to an instability
 in the test case and is thought to be counterbalanced by the viscosity
 at a higher amplitude range.
 Additionally, the cell size chosen for the simulation is close to the finest
 grid in the test which does not exhibit such amplification.
 Finally, from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:dissipation_and_dispersion_coefficient"

\end_inset

, for our frequencies of interest which is less that 10 kHz, it is is deduced
 that a cell size of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.002m$
\end_inset

 will give a system able to propagate the acoustic waves with a loss of
 approximately 0.01Np/m.
 This translates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx0.09 dB$

 is used instead for the far-field propagation.
 Being an exact rearrangement of the Navier-Stokes equation in the form
 of a wave equation and by using the free space Green’s function to obtain
 an analytic integral formula for the far field sound, FWH analogy enables
 fast computation of sound at a farfield location.
 For our work, the calculation is coded in the TurbAcAn solver, developed

  to process the flow recordings a posteriori and simple test cases were
 performed which are detailed in this section.
 Before delineating the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings implementation, we briefly
 summarize the basic theory first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation is an exact formulation derived from
 the Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of a stationary or moving body
 in a fluid medium.
 It is obtained using the same approach as for Lighthill's equation in free
 flow, extended to the presence of solid bodies.
 In addition, the variables are defined over the whole space by means of
 the Heaviside function and a characteristic function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 that is positive in the flow domain, negative inside the solid and zero
 on the solid boundary.
 The generalized Lighthill's equation thus obtained will have two new source
 terms in addition to the Lighthill's stress tensor.
 The resulting equation is the general Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation.
 It takes the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial t^{2}}-c_{0}^{2}\Delta\right\} \left[\rho_{a}H(f)\right]=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j}}\left[T_{ij}H(f)\right]-\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}\left[L_{i}\delta(f)\right]+\frac{\partial}{\partial t}[Q\delta(f)]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $H(f)$
\end_inset

 is the Heaviside function vanishing inside the solid body and experiencing
 a jump across the solid surface, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(f)$
\end_inset

 is the Dirac Delta function capturing the solid body surface.
 On the right hand side, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the Lighthill's stress tensor written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{ij}=\rho u_{i}u_{j}+p_{ij}-c^{2}\left(\rho-\rho_{0}\right)\delta_{ij}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the loading noise term, written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}L_{i} & =\left[\rho u_{i}\left(u_{j}-u_{j}^{\Sigma}\right)+P_{ij}\right]n_{j}\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the thickness noise term, written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned}Q & =\left[\rho\left(u_{j}-u_{j}^{\Sigma}\right)+\rho_{\infty}u_{j}^{\Sigma}\right]n_{j}\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\Sigma}$
\end_inset

 is the velocity of the surface in case of a moving surface.
 The formulation thus leads to two additional sources than the canonical
 form of the wave equation due to the treatment of the variables using the
 Heaviside function.
 The first of these, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}\left[L_{i}\delta(f)\right]$
\end_inset

, is called the loading noise term, and involves a first order spatial derivativ
e over the surface and is hence a dipole source term.
 The second term, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}[Q\delta(f)]$
\end_inset

, is called the thickness noise and captures on the mass flow rate fluctuation
 on the surface.
 It is omnidirectional (time derivative) and thus described as a monopole
 term.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Extension to arbitrary control surfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of these appear as a mathematical consequence of truncation of the
 boundary of the propagation domain using the Heaviside function suggesting
 that the presence of a distributed set of sources inside a chosen volume
 is in effect equivalent to having surface sources on any chosen surface
 as the boundary.
 Therefore an extension of the FWH equation is to replace the solid by a
 control volume, the surface of which is a permeable control surface.
 The same FWH equation source terms are modified as they account for mass
 and momentum flux across the surface.
 The contribution of the control volume to the equation is still zero as
 
\begin_inset Formula $H(f)$
\end_inset

 vanishes.
 Thus, instead of calculating the propagation of the sound from the exact
 source point, it is sufficient to have the recordings of their emanating
 wavefronts while they are incident on the chosen surface, and can then
 be used to model the equivalent surface sources for further propagation
 to the farfield.
 This enables to compute the noise generated by turbulence in complex flows
 by recording the emanated wave on an exterior surface surrounding the source
 region which are strongly perturbed by the turbulence in the interior.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another consequence of the formalism is that the canonical Lighthill's source
 term, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x_{i}\partial x_{j}}\left[T_{ij}H(f)\right]$
\end_inset

, is only dominant in the region of turbulent flows leading to the quadrupole
 source.
 But this source term is vanishing outside the region of active turbulence.
 If thought of as being computed on an imaginary surface enclosing a volume
 region which is first placed inside the turbulent region and then expanded
 towards outside of the active source region, the source energies associated
 with quadrupole source terms inside the volume are progressively transferred
 to the other two terms due to the mathematical analogy.
\end_layout

 The resulting integral equation first takes the form

\begin_layout Standard
The quadrupole term remains an integral over the volume and cannot be reduced
 to a surface integral.
 This this term is often omitted in practice on the condition that the Mach
 number is low, although this assumption is still under debate.
 This requirement is met if there is no active turbulence where the surface
 is placed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method leads to the calculation of the sound received by each observer
 at each time step as an integral on the recording surface.
 
\color black
The calculation thus uses the data on the surface locations at a time of
 emission which coincides with the condition that a source emitting sound
 at a particular time will have the wave reaching the observer at the particular
 observer time step, or precisely, the computation time step is the observer's
 time step or the reception time step.

\color brown
 
\color inherit
This retarded time formulation leads the calculation on the surface to be
 done at different source emission times for the same observer time step
 and hence is cumbersome although calculation aposteriori on the recorded
 data has been widely used and proven robust.

 gave the alternative definition that improved the numerical efficiency
 of this calculation.
 In his formulation, called the Advanced Time formulation, the calculation
 is instead done for each time step of the data available on the surface.
 Thus the computation time is now the emission time step.
 For this, the relation between reception time, now called the Advanced
 Time, and the emission time is calculated as

\[
t_{adv}=t+\mathscr{T}

\begin_layout Standard
is the time lag between the emission time and the reception time between
 a source at location 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 and an observer at location 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using this relation, the farfield sound due the fluctuation on the surface
 from each time step is distributed over the full time domain of listening
 for the observer.
 This enables simpler calculation since the data on surface is now accessed
 sequentially and only the listener time steps need to be calculated for
 each mesh point.
 Also, the data on the surface now requires only to be recorded at the resolutio
n of the observer time step, whereas in retarded time formulation, the requireme
nt of source terms at different emission times implies that the resolution
 of the flow recording had to be higher than the acoustic resolution for
 the observer to avoid errors due to discretisation of the emission times.
 However, in the Advanced Time approach, the distribution of the radiated
 sound on to discrete time steps for listener means that the calculated
 time lag from the source cell to the listener may not always coincide with
 the available discrete time step.
 This will necessitate an interpolation of the received sound.
 Nevertheless, a linear interpolation between two time steps was demonstrated
 to give satisfactory result in the original work of

As mentioned, for practical application, Casalino’s Advanced Time formulation

 also leads to retaining the volume integrals for the quadrupole source
 terms causing a restriction on the placement of the FWH surface.
 In our simulations of the high-lift airfoil, the surface is chosen to surround
 the acoustic sources in the vicinity of the airfoil and is kept far enough
 from the airfoil suction side to avoid strong vortices ejected from the
 slat cove.
 Nevertheless, it is impossible to have a surface that encloses the airfoil
 and does not lead to intersecting wake region downstream of the airfoil.
 Therefore, the surface is kept open downstream of the airfoil, so that
 no vorticity fluctuations are convected through the surface.
 An alternative approach to keeping an open surface is by using averaging
 surfaces in the downstream region where vortices are convected through
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 We do not choose this approach since our placement of the surface sufficiently
 far from the airfoil and extended downstream is shown to be able to recover
 the slat noise signature with a good agreement with the experiment in our
 validation test.

 approach the upper side of the surface but the generated spurious sound

 Nevertheless, this routine needed to be adapted to read data saved from

 An XDMF file reader was designed to read the data iteratively from memory
 for each time step of the recording and was used to compute the farfield
 sound.
 The following test case was then used to check the accuracy of the code
 and the new file reader.

 For this, a time varying pressure was applied to a spherical geometry of
 suitable size resulting in the radiation of a sound field.
 A spherical FWH surface was then used to record the field at some distance
 around the source.
 The FWH module TurbAcAn was then used to calculate the sound at observer
 positions farther away from the source.
 The radiated field was found in good agreement with the analytical solution
 and also with the recorded field at observer positions by Direct Noise
 Computation (DNC).

This solution can be used as a forcing agent for the LBM simulation to mimic
 the behavior of a Monopole source.
 But since the flow solver only enables specification of either velocity
 or pressure distribution, we choose the pressure as time varying forcing.
 This also limits the specification of source only as a farfield solution
 since in the near field of a Monopole source, the pressure and velocity
 fluctuations are out of phase, and hence both pressure and velocity need
 to be specified.
 On the other hand, in the farfield, the pressure and velocity oscillations
 are approximately in-phase, and hence a specification of pressure only
 as forcing term leads to velocity fluctuations that are approximately in-phase.

\begin_layout Standard
However, this amplitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $12.5Pa$
\end_inset

 is not recovered on the FWH surface during the simulation and observed
 waves tend to have a lower amplitude.
 This owes to the fact that the simulated harmonic pressure source efficiency
 is lower than that of an actual Monopole since the specified boundary condition
s in the LBM setting does not involve specification of the macro-variables
 but that of the particle population densities.
 The latter introduces additional complexity, as mentioned while discussing
 on Eq.

 Hence for the purpose of expediency towards study of acoustics, instead
 of using the explicitly specified source amplitude, the simulated amplitude
 available at the FWH surface is used to estimate the equivalent Monopole

 Simulated pressure amplitude on the FWH surface is obtained as

Choice of time stepping and cell size

\begin_layout Standard
According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

, the FWH scheme shows phase shifting depending on the time stepping used.
 Accordingly, a timestep corresponding to 75 points per time period of the
 wave is chosen for the first case study.
 Hence for the simulation, a time step 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t=2.66\times10^{-6}s$
\end_inset

, corresponding to 75 points for a wave with frequency 5000Hz is used.

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
The number of points per wavelength for minimal dissipation and dispersion

 Considering that maximum frequency of interest is 10 kHz, a cell size of
 0.002m was satisfactory.
 This corresponds to a value of 17 points per wavelength.
 The cell size used in current simulation is 1.6mm, and for a frequency of
 
\begin_inset Formula $5000Hz$
\end_inset

 of the source, this correspond to 34 points per wavelength.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spherical wave test case results from the FWH computation were compared
 with the analytical result.
 As shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ResultsTurbAcAn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the FWH routine implementation provides an accurate computation.
 Here the odd numbered probes are placed in the same 2D center plane as
 the source and the even numbered probes are placed on a diagonal line and
 out of the center plane.
 For all probes, the wave shape, frequency, amplitude, and delay times,
 for different observer locations are found to be in good agreement.
 The computation using the FWH surface are also compared with noise obtained
 at observer positions by direct recording, which is a Direct Noise Computation
 (DNC).
 For the DNC, the recordings shows deviations in the even numbered probes
 placed on the diagonals and also have notable phase variations.
 This is expected since, as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ResultsTurbAcAn"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the probes are placed outside the first level of refinement and the corner
 nodes at the coarsening distort the propagation of waves as discussed in
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Numerical-errors"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests that the propagation of waves through mesh refinements in
 the 
\emph on
ProLB
\emph default
  solver has room for improvement, particularly at the corner nodes of refinemen
t interfaces.

\begin_layout Standard
With the aim of running a parametric study on the HLD geometry of slat-airfoil
 configuration, we concocted a template based case setup for the LBM simulation.
 The voxel meshing combined with the immersed boundary method used for the
 
\emph on
ProLB
\emph default
  software enables meshing of the complicated flow domain in the slat cove
 with almost no user intervention during mesh generation and is thus very
 convenient for such a parameterisation.
 In this section, we first explain the choice of parameters that we selected
 for the template, which are the parameters of the LBM case setup for all
 simulations described in this thesis.
 The acoustic computation using FWH is also made part of this template since
 the surface placement can be chosen such that no case specific adjustments
 or repositioning is necessary.
 Following this case setup and injection of the geometries of the airfoil
 and slat, the complete simulation case files are compiled, where the relative
 position of the slat with respect to the main element are varied.
 The latter is then documented and post-processed in the following chapter.

, a square domain is selected with an extent of 25C, where 
\begin_inset Formula $C=0.3m$

 The boundaries are then supplied with appropriate macro flow variables
 as inlet and outlet boundaries.
 The inlet velocity is 
\begin_inset Formula $50 m/s$
\end_inset

 for all parametric simulations planned.
 For the outlet and farfield boundaries, a constant Pressure condition of
 101325 Pa is supplied.
 The domain boundaries are then supplanted with 
\begin_inset Formula $2m$

 of absorbing region with conditions to avoid reflection of the perturbations
 from the boundary.
 The absorbing boundary layers available in 
\emph on

 The relaxation parameters allow the macro-variables to be maintained or
 attenuated by altering the underlying particle populations
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In the case of the inlet velocity boundary, the velocity relaxation targets
 are fixed to the inlet velocity value so that the absorbing layer does
 not attenuate the incoming velocity into the domain.
 To avoid reflection of the pressure waves, the pressure relaxation target
 is set to be Dynamic.
 In the Dynamic setting, the Pressure is relaxed towards the mean thermodynamic
 equilibrium pressure by only attenuating the fluctuating pressure waves.
 This enables a clean and steady inlet velocity boundary condition.
 For the case of three other boundaries, i.e.
 the outlet plane and farfield planes at the pressure and suction side of
 the airfoil, the Pressure value is set to the atmospheric pressure.
 This Dirichlet condition requires that the Pressure field in the absorbing
 region needs to be relaxed to a fixed Pressure.
 Since the outflow is unconstrained, the velocity target is set to be Free,
 meaning that the relaxation of velocity is not performed.
 In the spanwise direction, periodic boundary conditions are applied.

On using periodic conditions for the flow, perturbations in the spanwise

\begin_inset Formula $2\pi n/L$

 to maintain spanwise correlation as well as to make the flow homogeneous
 over the span avoiding the spontaneous decorrelation of the flow.
 This artificially induced coherence needs to be avoided, particularly in
 view of the aeroacoustic mechanisms involving the role of spanwise coherent
 eddies in the slat cove, by using sufficiently long span length: we choose
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{z}=0.7C$

 which is significantly higher than that suggested in the work of

For generating the mesh layout, prudence is given to minimize the number
 of nodes in order to minimize the cost of simulations.
 This enables exploring the parameter space extensively.
 Hence, the meshing is initiated from the domain boundaries with the minimum
 possible cell size, i.e.
 same as spanwise domain length of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{z}=0.2m=0.66C$
\end_inset

.
 In previous sections, it was shown that to obtain a lossless propagation
 of the acoustics generated by the flow, we need to maintain a resolution
 of 17 points per wavelength and corresponding to the frequencies of interest
 upto 10 kHz, this corresponds to a cell size of approximately 1.6mm.
 Hence, a sub-region of the domain, marked as Resolution Level 4 in the
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SchematicDomain"

, is maintained at this cell-size to enable propagation of the generated
 noise.
 The FWH surface is also placed inside this region to record the perturbations
 so that the input to the FWH calculation does not involve spurious effects
 due to propagation on an unresolved grid.
 The airfoil geometry is then positioned inside the FWH surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Coordinate System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinate system of the airfoil for the simulation is chosen such that
 for variation of the angle of attack of the airfoil, the positioning of
 the FWH surface and the meshing on the airfoil does not necessarily change.
 For this we choose to keep the airfoil and FWH in steady position and update
 region of boundary conditions (together with absorbing regions) to reflect
 the change in the flow direction.
 Hence inlet velocity is specified using its vectorial components calculated
 from the required angle of attack with respect to the main element.

The boundary layer resolution required to simulate the flow is determined
 by the flow Reynolds number.
 For the case simulated in our work, the chord based Reynolds number is
 around 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

.
 Based on the slat chord, this corresponds to a Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.3\times10^{5}$
\end_inset

, and hence from the wall 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{+}$
\end_inset

 based on friction velocity, to maintain 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{+}<50$
\end_inset

, a cell size of 0.0003m is required.

 When a wall boundary is present with no-slip condition, the boundary nodes
 are provided with additional fictitious particles such that the momentum
 of the particles that would otherwise exit the domain is supplied back
 into the domain.
 This condition is called the bounce back condition

 Although it requires a few additional manipulations, it has shown to be
 sufficient to recover the Navier-Stokes behavior in the boundary layer.
 Additionally, with a Cartesian grid, the wall 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{+}$
\end_inset

 distribution cannot be definitively controlled in an LBM simulation.
 Hence a choice for the case is made by keeping the 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{+}$
\end_inset

 close to 50, where a boundary layer cell size of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times10^{-4}m$
\end_inset

 is chosen resulting in an effective 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{+}$
\end_inset

 of 35.
 This is based on the expectation that the boundary layer development happens
 along the wall within a length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.039m$
\end_inset

, which is the slat chord length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the specification of the near-wall cell size, this property is then
 attributed to the wall geometry.
 The Cartesian meshing algorithm then maintains this cell size in the region
 surrounding the wall and does the same until a few layers of the mesh away
 from the wall.
 The number of layers for our case is set to 6.
 This leads to having 6 layers of the cell size attributed to the solid
 wall around it an then automatic coarsening by factors of two following
 every 6 layers of the cells.
 The blocks of meshes with same sizes thus formed are the so called mesh
 Refinement Levels.
 Starting with the boundary cell size of 0.
\begin_inset Formula $0002m$
\end_inset

 as Refinement Level 1, and coarsening by factor of 2, the resolution as
 required by the acoustic propagation is obtained in Level 4.
 Hence, within the region of Level 4, as shown in the Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SchematicDomain"

\end_inset

, the mesh has 3 sub-levels, the exact shapes of which are primarily dictated
 by the shape of the wall geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To capture the aeroacoustic phenomena accurately, the slat cove flow has
 to be well resolved since the spanwise coherence of the vortical structures
 and their convection by the mean flow needs adequate fidelity as well as
 the sound back-propagating from the slat trailing edge to its cusp.
 To aid in accurate visualization of the vortices, and to obtain a smooth
 averaging of the flow, we choose to keep the boundary layer cell size constant
 throughout the slat cove.
 The same is also applied to a region downstream of the slat trailing edge
 and also downstream of the main element's trailing edge.
 The resulting mesh around the airfoil is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
Temporal scales
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LBM simulation time steps are primarily determined by the cell sizing.
 This is due to the fact that a fixed Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy number, 
\begin_inset Formula $CFL$
\end_inset

, is maintained in cell calculation.
 This means that during the timestepping, the time step calculated for each
 Refinement Levels are different corresponding to its cell size.
 The smallest time step corresponds to the Level 1 cells whose timestep
 is calculated as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
CFL=\frac{\Delta x}{c\Delta t\sqrt{3}}=1\implies\Delta t_{L1}=\frac{\Delta x_{L1}}{c\sqrt{3}}=3.46\times10^{-7}s
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the sound speed calculated at the reference temperature of 
\begin_inset Formula $276.48K$
\end_inset

.
 For higher Resolution levels whose cells size grows by a factor of 2, the
 timestep also grows by a factor of 2 and hence the time stepping for 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{th}$
\end_inset

resolution level is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t|_{Ln}=\Delta t_{L1}\times2^{n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The total number of time steps required for the simulation is dictated by
 the acoustic measurement requirements.
 For the reference wind tunnel experiment, the spectral resolution obtained
 is 1Hz.
 However this resolution is impossible to simulate since the number of time
 steps are prohibitively high.
 A good compromise is made when the resolution is decreased to 22Hz.
 For this resolution, the number of time steps required is given by the
 discrete Fourier transform theory by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N_{FFT}=\frac{f_{s}}{\Delta f}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{FFT}$
\end_inset

 is the number of time steps per averaging window of the Welsch method,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the sampling frequency.
 The sampling frequency is determined by the Nyquist-Shannon criterion,
 whereby the sampling rate of the signal must be at least twice the bandwidth
 of interest for the signal.
 This means that for slat noise spectra upto 
\begin_inset Formula $20 kHz$
\end_inset

, the sampling rate must be atleast 
\begin_inset Formula $40 kHz$
\end_inset

.
 To avoid the high frequency edge effects close to the edges of the band,
 it is common practice to maintain at least four times the sampling rate
 according to the Nyquist-Shannon criterion.
 In the current case, the FWH propagation region at Refinement Level 4 is
 maintained at the required resolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.6mm$
\end_inset

.
 The corresponding time step is hence 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{4-1}=8$
\end_inset

 times the simulation timestep and hence the recordings are done with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t_{FWH}=2.77\times10^{-6}s$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx360 kHz$
\end_inset

.
 However, to obtain a good trade-off between the length of the signal and
 the resolution, we choose to sample the FWH surface at half of this frequency,
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{s-FWH}\approx180 kHz$
\end_inset

.
 The number of time steps then follows as 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{FFT}\approx8200$
\end_inset

 time steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This combined with an averaging requirement for the Welsch algorithm of
 7 averages leads to a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $8200\times7=57400$
\end_inset

 timesteps for recording the flow at Refinement Level 4.
 The number of timesteps at Level 1 then translates to 
\begin_inset Formula $57400\times2^{3}=459200$
\end_inset

.
 An additional transient time is required to remove the initial transients
 in the simulation due to a non-physical initialization of the near wall
 flow.
 The resulting spurious waves need to be allowed to leave the domain to
 reach a converged flow state.
 Moreover, the flow characteristics leading to the acoustics are established
 once the macro-flow converges to steady oscillatory behavior.
 Hence an initial transient of 290000 iterations, equivalent of a physical
 time of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1s$
\end_inset

 (or more than 16 chord pass times for a stowed chord of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3m$
\end_inset

 in a flow at 50 m/s) are run before starting the recordings for post processing
 including FWH.
 This together with the recording timesteps demands a total of 874200 timesteps
 at Refinement level 1 for a simulation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, to accelerate the convergence, we utilize the two-step initializat
ion feature available with 
\emph on
ProLB
\emph default
 .
 Accordingly, the simulation initiates without fully resolving the mesh
 but only until Level 2.
 The simulation is then run until a physical time of 0.2 seconds corresponding
 to 144324 iterations at the time step of Refinement Level 2.
 The solver then fully resolves the mesh until Refinement Level 1 and interpolat
es the solution from Level 2 to Level 1, where necessary, to initalise the
 actual simulation.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For the particular case of the validation study that we present in this
 chapter, the simulations were conducted in the early stages of this work.
 Hence the required compute hours to run the simulations for 874200 time
 steps were not readily available.
 For managing the computing resource better, we therefore followed a sequential
 time-partitioning approach where one simulation is split into equal chunks
 of time intervals.
 For this we chose to create chunks which would be consistent with the Welsch
 averaging for the recorded sound spectrum, i.e.
 each chunk of the simulation was made to generate 
\begin_inset Formula $8200$
\end_inset

 time steps at a subsampling factor of 2 for Refinement Level 4, leading
 to total simulated time steps of 
\begin_inset Formula $8200\times2^{3}\times2=131200$
\end_inset

 per chunk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Furthermore, the restarts were made by recording the macro-variables of
 density and velocities at the last time step of each chunk, to be used
 to reinitialize the simulation for the next chunk.
 Using macro-variables for restarts are not ideal in the LBM setting since
 the restart will then involve conversion of the initial values of the macro
 variables to the probability density distributions of the LBM particles
 and introduces error which are not negligible in view of the acoustics.
 The restarts hence produce an acoustic reset which need an initial transient
 to re-converge to steady dynamics.
 For this an additional 24000 steps of initial transient is used in each
 chunk of the simulation leading to a total of 7 sub-simulations of 155200
 times steps each.
 It must be noted that this approach is only followed for the validation
 case study and for the future simulations leading to the parametric study,
 full simulations with continuous time stepping are utilized due to availability
 of computer resources.

The complete configuration of the wind tunnel setup of the original VALIANT

 This simulation was setup by Airbus engineers (Dr.

 Florian Guiho) and was reproduced at the ECL facility for the purpose of
 testing the version of the code for producing reference data.

 The total physical time of the simulation in our standard free stream configura

\begin_inset Formula $0.2s$
\end_inset

 in comparison to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.078s$
\end_inset

 in the current one and is driven by the necessity of computer resources
 while including the wind tunnel geometry meshes.
 With a reduced signal length, the computation leads to spectra with lower
 resolution also.
 The FWH surface was placed inside the cavity covered by the shear layer
 from the nozzle lip, to avoid shear layer vortices crossing the FWH surface.
 The two main differences between a free-stream simulation and a wind-tunnel
 case are that while a spanwise periodic condition is used in the free-stream
 case, a wall boundary is applied in the wind tunnel case mimicking the
 experimental setup, and that the free-stream case is not in a jet but a
 uniform flow.
 Consequently, for spanwise periodic condition, the spanwise acoustic domain
 is theoretically infinite.
 However, the periodic condition numerically copies the data between the
 spanwise boundaries thereby enforcing congruence of the flow variables
 at both boundaries.
 Hence, although the domain is infinite for acoustic propagation, it may
 trigger spurious periodic behaviors in the flow with wavelengths that confer
 to the domain length, i.e a standing pressure wave based on the spanwise
 periodicity might arise in the free stream case even if this is not the
 case in the actual wind-tunnel.
 Another effect of the spanwise periodic condition is that it tends to exert
 spanwise homogeneity in the flow if the spanwise domain length is smaller
 than that which would allow three dimensionality to develop.
 This has been investigated in previous works for the same geometry as that
 used in the present simulations

 showed that for the development of three-dimensionality of the coherent
 structures in the cove region, a spanwise extend of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.75c_{s}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the slat chord is necessary.
 For the current case simulated, this corresponds to a length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0312m$
\end_inset

 while the actual simulated span length is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2m$
\end_inset

 corresponding to more than 6 times the suggested value.
 Hence this factor is not expected to affect the features of the flow simulated
 in our case and the three dimensionality is expected to develop unhindered.

\begin_layout Standard
That being the differences between the two cases, the wind tunnel installation
 effects are necessary to explain a few of the disparities between our standard
 free stream simulation and the reference experiment.
 As will be demonstrated in the following chapter, the simulation tends
 to obtain a better agreement with the experiment if the installations are
 included, particularly for the broadband levels and the strength of the
 first tone.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter in its early development details the Lattice Boltzmann method
 and the basis of its suitability for the aeroacoustic simulations.
 The low dissipation and dispersion characteristics that are implicitly
 available in the LBM schemes are then put to test in the commercial solver
 
\shape italic
ProLB
\shape default
 and a quantitative but empirical characterization of the dissipation performanc
e is obtained.
 Guided by this development, a further reduction of the computation cost
 for noise calculation is achieved by deploying an in-house Ffowcs Williams-Hawk
ings module Turb'AcAn.
 The software was then successfully tested for its accuracy on a Gaussian
 pulse propagation test case.
 In the later part of the chapter, the simulation setup designed to enable
 slat noise investigations using the same framework is detailed.
 The simulation parameters are obtained based on the data available from
 the test cases mentioned and necessary compromises are made to enable computati
onally affordable simulations.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A high fidelity Lattice Boltzmann solver ProLB was studied and empirically
 tested for basic acoustic propagation behaviors in the early part of this
 chapter.
 Upon validation that the acoustic propagation performance is satisfactory
 and obtaining the necessary mesh requirements for aeroacoustic simulations,
 the solver was used to simulate the acoustics of the 3 element VALIANT
 high-lift geometry in free flow conditions.
 The free-stream velocity is maintained at 
\begin_inset Formula $50 m/s$
\end_inset

 corresponding to a chord based Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}.$
\end_inset

 The spanwise domain was simulated to have infinite length by using periodic
 conditions.
 The total spanwise length of the free stream simulation was also carefully
 selected such that the spanwise periodic conditions does not induce artificial
 homogeneity in the spanwise direction leading to hindering development
 of the three dimensional features.
 A Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings solver TurbAcAn was then adapted, tested, and
 deployed along with ProLB, to enable farfield noise computation within
 computational constraints.
 The results showed that framework is able to satisfactorily capture the
 acoustic signature of the HLD to high level of accuracy in view of the
 tone frequencies.
 The broadband noise is also found to be in reasonable agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Primary discrepancies in the free stream simulation compared to the experiment
 was that the main tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

, corresponding to the second Rossiter tone, was found to be weaker in the
 free stream simulation.
 Other differences in the flow was such that recirculation strength was
 found to be weaker with a reduced velocity difference across the initial
 shear layer.
 To study these discrepancies, an additional simulation that included the
 full geometry of the VALIANT experimental setup was also used.
 This simulation was initially done for commercial purposes at the Airbus
 Toulouse facility by committing resources required for a very high-fidelity
 simulation of the same HLD configuration together with the wind tunnel
 jet and the shear layer issued by the same.
 The same was reproduced in the Ecole Centrale facility with a reduced total
 simulation length to obtain relevant data.
 The results showed that the inaccuracies in the free stream simulations
 are significantly corrected by inclusion of the wind-tunnel.
 The SPL of the main tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771Hz$
\end_inset

 was recovered to obtain a better agreement with the experiment for the
 farfield observer and for the wall pressure spectra inside the cove.
 For the difference of recirculation velocity, the recirculation speeds
 at the spanwise mid-plane was also seen to improve significantly if the
 lateral side plates are present in the simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These results using the solver thus shows that the performance of the code
 framework is satisfactory in its fidelity with the experiment.
 The difference in the results being explained as due to the difference
 of flow configuration suggest that the solver is useful in investigating
 the slat flow phenomena and acoustics beyond the limitations of the experiment
 which cannot be designed to remove completely the effect of solid spanwise
 boundaries which are necessary to support the HLD in the wind tunnel.
 For further study of the slat noise phenomena in this thesis, we therefore
 utilize the free stream simulation setup validated in this chapter to generate
 the flow related data for various positions of the slat.
 Nevertheless, before proceeding to run a parametric simulation campaign,
 we take a detour to further investigate the data collected as part of this
 simulation to obtain new and valuable insights into the cove flow phenomenology
 and its related acoustics.
 This investigation is detailed in the upcoming chapter.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 3D Lattice Boltzmann Method can provide a high fidelity description
 of sound-flow interactions and will therefore be applied to an in-depth
 analysis of the slat noise mechanisms.
 The ProLB solver with its advanced functionalities enable the recording
 of the flow field to sufficient resolution such that the turbulent structures
 and their dynamics in the cove can be visualized with great detail.
 Hence this chapter is dedicated to our investigation of the cove flow phenomena
 using the data collected during our simulation of a well documented experiment
 carried out in the European project VALIANT.
 This data is used to optimize the simulation and to validate it.
 The configuration is that of a

, here with only the standard positioning of the slat with respect to the
 main element.
 This configuration has the slat coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $[\text{Angle of Attack - }AOA=18.0^{o},\text{Slat Deflection Angle - }SDA=35.2\text{mm},\text{Slat Gap - }SGP=7.94\text{mm},\text{Slat Overlap - }SOL=-6.36\text{mm}]$

The cove vortex dynamics has been studied to great detail using LES and
 RANS simulations and also by experimental investigations in the literature

.
 The most agreed upon explanation of the characteristic slat noise is due
 to the presence of spanwise coherent vortices which are formed in the early
 shear layer near the slat cusp.
 These vortices are then convected towards the slat trailing edge where
 they undergo collision with the slat wall and deform such that their spanwise
 coherence is lost
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Manoha2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As a consequence, the ejected vortices has majorly streamwise orientation
 with only a portion of the spanwise coherence retained to cause the generation
 of acoustic waves which can close the aeroacoustic resonance loop
\color black
.
 In how much of this spanwise coherence can be retained at the impingement
 location is thus the determining factor for the presence of Rossiter tones
 and their strengths.
 Nevertheless, the mechanism of disintegration of the spanwise coherent
 structures are not studied widely and hence their effect on the noise generatio
n is not fully understood.

Our investigation in this direction lead to the fact that the curved shape

The behavior of a curved shear also lead us to investigate the three dimensional
ity of the dynamics.
 Here, the curved shear layer acting as a boundary for a recirculating cavity
 has spanwise modulations which are known to have additional low frequency
 oscillations.
 Our investigation of the same in the cove recirculation region lead to
 uncover the formation of large scale spanwise structures.
 This showed that the spanwise modulations in the slat cove are not only
 at the scales of the small scale streamwise eddies formed at impingement
 but also at scales comparable to the slat chord length, leading to the
 formation of steady spanwise cells within the recirculation region.
 These cell formations were not known apriori in the case of slat cove dynamics

 vortices in the works of

 establish a relationship between the spanwise cell formation and the shape

To begin, we first validate the simulation framework for aeroacoustic computatio
ns by comparing its accuracy against experimental data using a standard
 geometry in a free-stream configuration.
 This serves as the baseline for the validation process.
 Next, we examine a case that includes the full installation effects and
 explain the differences observed in the results.
 Additionally, we present further simulation results based on variations
 of the same geometry, including one where the inlet velocity is reduced
 and another where the spanwise length of the simulation domain is shortened.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Additionally we also include a few additional results from simulations of
 related cases to the same geometry, first by including the wind tunnel
 geometry and lateral side walls, second by reducing the inlet velocity
 and a third by reducing the spanwise length of the simulation domain, all
 demonstrating formation of the spanwise modulations independent of these
 parameters.

In all of these cases, the three dimensionality is observed, demonstrating
 that such modulations occur independently of these parameters.

 The convergence of the unsteady dynamics and mean wall pressure distributions

 Subsequently, the probe data recordings are analyzed and finally the FWH
 computations are discussed to validate the aeroacoustic capabilities of

Convergence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In LBM simulations the convergence is checked primarily by using the unsteady
 data recorded using numerical probes in the simulation.
 This is due to the fact that unlike conventional solvers, the LBM approach
 calculates a simulation time step without iterative procedures
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Feng2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Hence a useful monitor for the stationarity of the simulated aerodynamics
 is the unsteady forces on the solid geometries.
 ProLB enable users to integrate the surface forces over the solid wall
 geometries using native functions and is deployed to extract the results.
 The force components which are in the direction of the X coordinate axis
 are taken to be the drag force and the one in Y direction is taken to be
 the lift force.
 This directionality are not exactly accurate since the angle of attack
 of the main element is not aligned with the coordinate axes.
 Nevertheless, for convergence monitoring the directionality is not relevant.
 The recordings obtained are shown in Fig.

 The unsteady loading show satisfactory convergence after a total physical
 time of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05\,s$

 and the mean values are steady after

A second monitor is the unsteady data from critical locations of the flow.
 Here the slat cove dynamics can be monitored using the wall pressure sensor

 As can be noted, there is a general agreement of the

 distribution.
 However, the suction pressure on the slat is slightly higher in the simulation
 whereas it is lower for the main element as compared to experiment.
 This difference owes to the fact that in the experiment the wind-tunnel
 installation has additional features including the finite width jet.
 The static pressure over the airfoil also causes a potential effect which
 interferes with the wind tunnel jet exit to modify the exit pressure distributi
on.

The difference of angle of attack for the experiment and the simulation
 is also a factor affecting the pressure distribution.
 For the experiment, the airfoil is kept at 
\begin_inset Formula $25^{o}$
\end_inset

 to the jet exit direction and for the corresponding simulation in free
 stream condition, the angle of attack is reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $18^{o}$
\end_inset

.
 This is a method to correct the change in effective deflection.
 The equivalent angle of attack between the free stream case and the wind
 tunnel case was obtained empirically by matching the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 distributions from the free stream RANS simulations and actual experimental
 values, done by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The VALIANT HLD geometry was also obtained by replacing the flap of the
 base three-element configuration with a sharp trailing edge by keeping
 this equivalence of the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 distribution.
 Hence the same angle of attack of 
\begin_inset Formula $18^{o}$
\end_inset

 with the free stream is maintained for our comparison with the experiment
 as well.

The discrepancies related to difference of configurations are alleviated
 to a good extend if the simulation setup includes the full wind tunnel
 installation geometries.
 Such a simulation, together with a few additional cases varying the angle
 of attacks for free stream simulation, are detailed in the Appendix A Section

The pressure on the main-element also shows a spatially local sharp peak
 which owes to the acceleration of the flow in the nozzle like shape of
 the slat gap.
 This feature is more prominent in the simulation since continuous data
 over the airfoil wall is available.
 This acceleration is responsible for the high velocity ejection of the
 slat turbulence from the slat trailing edge and hence is likely to drive
 both the characteristic low frequency broadband noise and the high frequency
 noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The case with the inclusion of the wind-tunnel shows a better agreement
 with the experiment for the attacking surface of the slat.
 This is due to the better capturing of the potential effect due to the
 airfoil near the nozzle exit where the exit flow is not uniform across
 the cross flow direction.
 In the full configuration simulation, the static pressure was not measured
 and the velocity was also not uniform, but with minor fluctuations (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1 m/sm/s$
\end_inset

 which has no measurable effect on the static pressure).
 This might be due to the fact that the static pressure is globally underestimat
ed in the free-field simulation.
 Hence the 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}$
\end_inset

 value at the leading edge of the main element can be seen to be weaker
 in the same case.

However, the suction pressure on both the slat and the main element is higher
 in the experiment suggesting that the total lift is higher in the experimental

 This discrepancy is due to the uniform inflow conditions in the free stream
 simulation.

Although not conclusively, the acceleration is also responsible for the

 drives the Rossiter oscillations.
 The differences of the

 flow from the experiment such that in the experiment, the suction peak
 is observed to be stronger and hence leading to stronger broadband noise

The experiment tend to have the highest lift load owing to the fact that
 the HLD generates a strong deflection of the narrow width jet, thereby
 generating a strong lift.

It can be noted that both cases show a reasonable agreement with the experiment
 regarding the tonal frequencies.
 For the SPL, the first tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

 tends to be better captured by the wind tunnel simulation whereas it is
 almost vanishing in most free stream curves.
 A good agreement can be seen in general for all higher frequency tones
 (not all harmonics) along with consistently higher broadband SPL in simulations.
 A higher SPL suggests that the pressure fluctuations in the cove are more
 energetic in the simulations than the experiment.

 The experiment and simulation which includes the wind tunnel installation
 geometries tend to have a better agreement of the average velocity data.
 In both cases, the velocity recovers the free stream velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $50\,m/s$
\end_inset

 and shows a mean recirculation velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $8\,m/s$
\end_inset

 on the cove side.
 In comparison, the flow in free stream simulation tends to develop a slightly
 weaker shear layer, with the free stream velocity recovering to 
\begin_inset Formula $43\,m/s$
\end_inset

 and the inner cove recirculation to 
\begin_inset Formula $12\,m/s$
\end_inset

.
 The velocity ratio between the inner and outer flows, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U_{i}}{U_{o}}$
\end_inset

, is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $0.16$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.27$
\end_inset

 for wind-tunnel and free stream simulation respectively.
 This suggest that a perfect capturing of the shear layer thickness and
 strength requires the presence of the full installation.

A few factors can explain this disparity.
 In the free stream simulation, the incoming flow is homogeneous and laminar.
 Hence the boundary layer and the turbulence therein are developed locally
 and spontaneous.
 On the contrary, the incoming flow in the experimental setup and its simulation
 has multiple sources of turbulence upstream of the HLD, i.e.
 the shear layer of the nozzle generates a shedding of vorticity and spanwise
 plates that support the HLD develops a fully turbulent boundary layer upstream
 of the HLD.

The corner flow then allows this vorticity to be convected into the spanwise
 extend.
 From studying the mean flow field, only 
\begin_inset Formula $20\%$
\end_inset

 of the spanwise extend can be seen to the fairly unaffected by the corner
 flow and the rest of the spanwise extend is strongly turbulent.
 These differences between the free stream simulation and the experiment
 hence affect the vorticity thickness of the shear layer and hence the strength
 of shear layer.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The velocity ratio across the shear layer has an important role in determining
 the dynamics of the flow especially the acoustics.
 Among many, the primary effect is that it determines the strength of the
 Rossiter mechanism.
 The shed vorticity from the cusp leads to the generation of the spanwise
 coherent eddies which excite the resonance and hence a reduction of the
 shear strength will weaken the generated vorticity, eventually weakening
 the resonance.
 As will be shown next, this can be one influential factor leading to the
 diminished strength of the first tone in the free stream simulation as
 compared to the experiment.

Another important aspect is that the velocity ratio may affect the strength
 of the centrifugal effect arising from the shear layer curvature and the
 recirculation.
 A detailed study of this aspect is presented in the chapter following this
 one and hence we restrict to a short mention.
 The centrifugal effect which is reasoned to the be driver of the spanwise
 mode formations inside the cove and its associated secondary low frequency
 fluctuations are linked to the difference between the inner cove flow and
 the outer high speed flow.
 The Strouhal number of these fluctuations leads the periodic disruption
 of coherence of the shed vorticity and hence modulates the first Rossiter
 modes via amplitude modulation.
 Hence, to maintain fidelity regarding the secondary flow and the acoustic
 features inside the cove, capturing the velocity ratio is important.
 Nevertheless, this secondary flow features and a possible amplitude modulation
 is a novel finding during this work and hence the numerical framework was
 not initially designed particularly to maintain fidelity regarding centrifugal
 effects and it must be so for future investigations.
 For the current study, the free stream flow is noted to have a difference
 of strength of the shear layer and recirculation, and is related to the
 differences obtained in the predicted acoustic spectra.
 Consequently, we proceed this thesis with this understanding of these possible
 disparities and utilize the compute optimizations obtained from a free
 stream configuration in comparison compared to a full scale simulation,
 for a more extensive parametric investigation of the cove flow phenomena.

Given that the unsteady dynamics has many features worthy of further exploration
, it is important to understand the time-averaged fields in tandem.
 The mean flow field convects the fluid and its vortices to establish the
 macro-flow features like the accelerated flow through the slat gap and
 the recirculation region.
 Within this configuration, the unsteadiness can be thought to be introduced
 by the generation of vorticity due to the presence of slat cusp or the
 shear layer.
 These vortices then develop unsteady dynamics which leads to the aeroacoustics.
 Hence the vortex dynamics itself is intrinsically first determined by the
 established mean flow.

 The region of impingement is distinctly identifiable as a region of high
 pressure due to the partial stagnation of the flow and hence the reduction
 in the flow area through the slat gap.
 It is also evident that the low pressure core of the cove due to recirculation
 is not exactly at the center of recirculation itself but shifted nearer
 to the shear layer.

 The spanwise velocity is then visualized on this plane with suitable color
 map to identify the local sign of spanwise velocity.
 As can be observed, the `spanwise cells', as we like to refer to the region
 of same velocity direction, appear to be stacked periodically with alternating
 signs.
 The magnitude of mean spanwise velocity is close to

The spanwise modulations and their obscurity in slat noise literature lead
 us to many interesting thoughts of which the following three are worthy
 of mention:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First is that the alternating time-averaged spanwise velocity cells means
 that there exist static nodal planes towards which the flow can converge
 and diverge from.
 Those planes whose both sides have spanwise velocity such that it decreases
 from positive to negative along the spanwise direction and hence have the
 flow directed towards the plane will be referred to as the `converging
 plane'.
 The other type of planes where the spanwise velocity increases from negative
 to positive necessitating the flow to diverge from the plane are the `diverging
 planes'.
 Since these planes act as sources and sinks for the spanwise dynamics,
 they must facilitate the interaction of the spanwise dynamics with the
 2-dimensional dynamics in the streamwise direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Second is that if such nodal planes exist, it is necessary that there must
 exist a mechanism to redistribute the fluid from the converging planes
 and to replenish the diverging planes continuously to establish a steady
 dynamics.
 Here, we have already seen that the recirculating small scale streamwise
 vortices are absorbed into the shear layer in regions near the mid trajectory.
 This suggest that for a converging plane, the mechanism to redistribute
 the fluid is by entrainment of the flow along with the streamwise structures
 into the shear layer, which must also lead to higher concentration (spanwise)
 of streamwise structures at the locations of the converging planes.
 There must also be a lower concentration of the streamwise structures in
 the diverging planes.
 Nevertheless, this may not be a phenomena easily observed in a largely
 turbulent state at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=10^{6}$
\end_inset

 with constant generation, distortion, and redistribution of vorticity,
 as in the slat cove.

The driving factor for the spanwise modulations should be the result of
 a dynamic instability either due to the shear layer geometry or due to
 the recirculating flow.
 Similar spanwise modulations are documented for flow over a backward facing
 step by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Their work demonstrated the existence of large scale spanwise modulations
 in the shear layer due to the presence of a backward facing step, and argues
 that the spanwise modulations are the result of an absolute convective
 instability owing to the closed loop streamline in the recirculation bubble
 leading to generation of steady spanwise modes.
 The eigen functions identified in their work using the linear stability
 analysis of a simplified flow configuration predicts the spanwise wavelength
 with same order as that of the cavity depth.
 This is consistent with the observation that the spanwise cells in the
 slat cove have a wavelength with same order as the slat chord.
 On comparing the rectangular flow cavity with the slat cove, the cavity
 depth is analogous to the diameter of the recirculating cove flow, and
 this diameter is approximately the slat chord.
 Their study also suggest a critical Reynolds number, although at a low
 range of 
\begin_inset Formula $Re_{c}=748$
\end_inset

, from which the spanwise modulations are dominant and this critical Reynolds
 number is also argued to be decreased when a lateral side wall is present.
 In the case of simulations with spanwise periodic conditions mimicking
 an infinite spanwise domain, the critical Reynolds number is also increased.
 The case of slat cove dynamics is at a Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 based on the mean flow and if considering the flow inside the cove region,
 taking the mean velocity to be 
\begin_inset Formula $20\,m/s$
\end_inset

, and the characteristic length scale to be the slat chord, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}=0.039\,m$
\end_inset

, corresponding Reynolds number is at 
\begin_inset Formula $54000$
\end_inset

.
 This regime is still two orders of magnitude higher than that required
 to trigger the convective instability
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The presence of spanwise walls are also of much importance for the slat
 cove flow as well, since, in our simulations we employ periodic conditions,
 and in experimental studies the lateral side walls are necessary to support
 the HLD mockup in the wind tunnel.
 Hence, drawing parallels between the fact that the flow over a backward
 facing step is much similar to the cove flow, particularly due to the fact
 that both cases have one side bounded by a shear layer and both have a
 recirculation bubble in which the spanwise modes tend to dominate, we suspect
 the same mechanism is also in action in the slat cove dynamics.

 For the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Neary1987"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, three regimes of flow for an open rectangular cavity based on the Reynold's
 number was identified.
 In the first, there is a strong interaction of the shear layer with the
 recirculating vortex inside the cavity.
 In a second regime of higher Reynolds number, the interaction leads to
 intermittent behavior leading to a bursting phenomena where the recirculating
 vortex tends to oscillate in size leading to it bursting through the shear
 layer to release vorticity.
 While doing so, the flow is said to be strongly turbulent.
 In the third regime typically at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=33500$
\end_inset

, (for our low speed cove recirculation, 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=54000$
\end_inset

), the bursting oscillations and associated pressure oscillations become
 more frequent but irregular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the later work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the rectangular cavities were further analyzed using three-dimensional
 global instability analysis to show that the spanwise instability wavelength
 scales are proportional to the cavity depth.
 The resulting spanwise modulated flow also develop oscillations that can
 induce a low frequency pulsation of the recirculating vortex.
 This frequency was deduced to have one order of magnitude lower than the
 Rossiter oscillations.
 The dependence of the growth rate of the spanwise modes with Reynolds number
 was also identified along with a critical value that would trigger the
 formation of the spanwise modes.
 However, the most interesting argument made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 was that the spanwise instability was a result of the curvature of the
 flow, i.e.
 the curved streamline of the recirculating vortices in the cavity would
 lead to a centrifugal instability that is different from the Rossiter oscillati
ons and the Görtler type instability that occurs on curved boundary walls.
 This argument finds its strength from the fact that the location of the
 strongest spanwise modulation is in the region of strong curvature of the
 recirculation bubble on the downstream corner of the cavity.
 The spanwise modulated recirculation vortex would develop also a low frequency
 oscillation, and this additional oscillations can interfere with the Rossiter
 modes to modulate both its frequency and peak amplitudes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
That being noted on the spanwise mode formations, the same argument, along
 with the fact that for both the shear layer on a backward facing step and
 the recirculation streamline in open cavity flows have, in common, a curved
 streamline with one side bounded by a shear layer, we choose to investigate
 the case of slat cove dynamics in terms of its peculiarities arising from
 curved streamline path of its shear layer.
 In line with this hypothesis, the behavior of a curved shear layer was
 also studied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"

\end_inset

.
 His work studied the linear inviscid hydrodynamic stability of a slightly
 curved free shear layer.
 The study compared the cases of a stably curved and unstably curved shear
 layer identifying sensitivity of the flow to the addition of curvature
 to an already present shear layer.
 The formation of Görtler vortices was identified as a possible reason for
 the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs while
 the unstably curved regime is present.
 The work also provides a non-dimensional parameter, the curvature Richardson
 number, to quantify the effect of an accelerated generation of streamwise
 vortices and will be used for comparison in our study as well.

From the above-mentioned array of ideas, we tend to theorize that the slat
 cove dynamics at the current Reynolds number has the following features
 and explanations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slat shear layer formed due to the difference of velocity between the
 free-stream and the recirculation vortex leads to the canonical Kelvin-Helmholt
z (K-H) instability as well identified in the literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Terracol2016,Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The saturation of K-H instability leads to the generation of 2-dimensional
 spanwise coherent structures being shed periodically from the cusp.
 If these vortices were to be convected in a straight line path, their behavior
 would only have the peculiarities of a vortex convected through an accelerated
 flow.
 However, since the established mean flow is such that the streamlines are
 curved along with the shear layer to facilitate flow through the slat gap,
 the vortices also follow a curved trajectory.
 This curvature of the streamline necessarily have a mean diameter of curvature
 similar in magnitude to the slat chord length.
 The spanwise coherent vortices which undergo such strong curvature experience
 an additional centrifugal force.
 Here, the pressure distribution inside the slat cove is lower than the
 pressure outside the cove region due to the fact that the region outside
 the slat cove is at the pressure side of the main element and is affected
 by presence of stagnation point on the main-element.
 Hence, the normal pressure gradient along the shear layer is positive along
 a radius of curvature of the shear layer with center of rotation inside
 the cove.
 This radial pressure gradient opposes the centrifugal force thereby requiring
 a balancing of these forces to enable a stable flow.
 This is the classical requirement for a dynamic instability to occur where
 two opposing forces which are supposed to be balanced are, in reality,
 not exactly and dynamically balanced, thereby leading to large growth rate
 for certain class of perturbations.
 The curved shear layer is hence susceptible to the curvature instability
 leading to the typical steady spanwise modes primarily attached to the
 shear layer as described by

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, it can be noticed that for the early part of the shear layer, the lower
 velocity flow is on the concave side of the shear layer curvature.
 This is a stable curvature since according to Rayleigh criteria the equilibrium
 is stable against curvature instability if the angular momentum decreases
 radially outward
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rayleigh1917"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In early shear layer, the streamline velocity is increasing radially outward
 from the cove center and hence the curvature instability is stabilized.
 Furthermore, as inferred by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the initial K-H instability may also be stabilized partially leading to
 a reduced growth rate of the streamwise perturbations suggesting a delayed
 spanwise vortex generation due to the effect of curvature.
 Hence, in this regime, the major noticeable dynamics are a delayed generation
 of K-H vortices as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 together with the large spanwise modulations arising from the convective
 instability of the recirculation from the suggestion of

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the flow progresses downstream, the shear layer weakens due to its spreading
 and growth of spanwise vortices.
 Simultaneously, the radius of curvature also decreases to eventually reverse
 its sign.
 Once the sign of curvature reverses and re-strengthen near the vicinity
 of the slat trailing edge region, i.e., the streamlines curve such that the
 low pressure area of the suction peak on the main element is again on the
 concave side of the streamlines near the slat gap, and the high pressure
 region generated due to the impingement of the shear layer on the slat
 trailing edge is on its convex side.
 This reversed configuration of pressure gradient is again opposing the
 centrifugal acceleration facilitating curvature instability again.
 However, unlike the early shear layer, the velocity field can be noticed
 to have the high velocity stream on the concave side of the curvature.
 This according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is the unstably curved configuration and satisfy the Rayleigh criterion
 to have a radially decreasing angular momentum.
 Hence the shear layer now develops a strong centrifugal instability leading
 to the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs.
 This generation of small scale structures are strongly accelerated by the
 presence of the ingested vortices from the recirculation region.
 It must be clearly noted that the regime of flow near the slat trailing
 edge is the asymptotic case for the linear stability analyzed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 whose conclusions are only directly valid for a curved free shear layer
 with small curvatures.
 The effective range of curvature Richardson numbers for their analysis
 is of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 where for the slat shear layer, these are on average two orders of magnitude
 higher as we will show in the upcoming session.
 Hence, for the later part of the shear layer near the impingement location
 and flow through the slat gap, the major phenomena is the curvature instability
 driven by a considerably lower radius of curvature with a mean velocity
 distribution enabling a fully unstable configuration.
 The only noticeable effect is hence the generation of streamwise oriented
 counter rotating vortex pairs which assimilate into larger streamwise vortices
 on the slat trailing edge and are elongated and ejected through the slat
 gap.
 The terminology used in the recent literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wang2019,Wang2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that these are `Görtler like' transition is hence logically valid, although
 there is no curved boundary layer as in the case of the canonical Görtler
 transition that leads to small scale streamwise oriented structures.
 Note that since this is a purely centrifugal instability, meaning that
 this generation of streamwise structures would happen even if there was
 no supply of spanwise coherent vortices in the impinging shear layer, as
 reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wang2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Their work demonstrates that at low enough Reynolds numbers, the periodic
 vortex shedding from the slat cusp is suppressed, possibly due to the combined
 effect of the stabilization of K-H instability due to curvature and the
 low Reynolds number, and the only noticeable turbulence generation is that
 of the streamwise vortices near the trailing edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, inside the recirculation, the flow developing spanwise modulation
 was previously unidentified in the literature although it was noticed early
 that the vorticity ejected from the slat gap had spanwise modulations.
 The flow in the cove region was largely analyzed under the assumption that
 it is spanwise homogeneous, and at this point of understanding the cove
 dynamics, it is striking why the prediction of cove flow and related acoustics
 remained elusive from a perfectly predictive modelling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Souza2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This we suggest is due to the fact that the three dimensionality of the
 flow due to the spanwise modulation would induce additional oscillations,
 suggestively with frequency one order of magnitude lower than the first
 Rossiter tone, which can modulate the tonal frequencies and the amplitude
 of the peaks as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"

\end_inset

 This tone, or more precisely a broadband hump in the low frequency was
 clearly identified in the work of

, who characterized the same as having a different source mechanism compared

 turbulent region like that of the slat cove and flow around the airfoil
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, together with the fact that the intermittent bursting phenomena associated
 with oscillation of the recirculation vortex can both significantly broaden
 the frequency bandwidth of fluctuations effected by this mechanism on a
 far-field microphone.
 This broadband hump is also in the low frequency range which is dominated
 by the measurement noise from the experimental setup and noise from the
 shear layer of the open jet wind tunnel adding to their elusiveness.
 Thus when tonal character of slat noise was rightly identified as those
 related to the Rossiter mechanism by

The placement of FWH surfaces requires careful consideration for reasons
 detailed in the previous chapter.
 The primary challenge is the positioning the surface to allow vortical
 structures to exit the computational region without crossing it.
 However, utilizing an open surface inherently reduces predicted pressure
 levels, as acoustic wave fronts from internal sources interact with the
 entire surface area, albeit with varying timing and amplitudes.
 This challenge is mitigated by spherical spreading, where wave amplitudes
 decay with increasing distance from the source.
 Consequently, surface regions far from the source contribute less significantly
 to the far-field observer measurements.
 This physical behavior allows positioning of the open part of the surface
 sufficiently downstream from the main element while maintaining acceptable
 accuracy

To optimize surface placement and evaluate far-field sound contributions,
 we conducted multiple test cases.
 Our investigation began with an oval surface positioned close to the airfoil,
 which was progressively modified into a C-shape and enlarged to contain
 the ejected cove vorticity within the airfoil's suction side, thereby preventin
g spurious effects.
 While results from the oval surface testing are presented in Appendix A,
 we focus here on the optimal C-shaped surface configuration here.

.
 Their primary utility is in the open ended shape which allows the convected
 vortices to exit through the open side and since the open side can be kept
 sufficiently far, the radiation of the downstream eddies is expected to
 have a negligible effect onto the sound field regions that are upstream
 of the surface open end.
 In our case they also allow to avoid large size low vorticity structures
 on the suction side by careful placement.
 They also provide sufficient space to be confidently deployed to parametric
 case simulations such that when the slat positioning is varied, the increase
 or decrease of ejected flow will not necessarily cross the upper part of
 the surface, thereby enabling easier parameterisation.
 The C-surface placement plotted against the dilatation field around the
 airfoil is shown in Fig.

 All microphones show a steady mean-pressure that corresponds to the local
 flow pressure as the microphones places in the non-turbulent region.
 The mean pressure is however not same across the probes and a constant
 pressure at the ambient is subtracted from the total pressure for the FWH
 calculation.
 The residual value of pressure reflects as the non-zero mean value of the
 microphone recording, but does not affect the calculations of farfield
 sound since only the time derivative of pressure is used in the FWH formulation
 and not the absolute values.Accordingly, to avoid the DC component in the
 spectra computed using Welsh's method, a constant local mean subtraction
 is also enabled for each of the averaging windows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting spectra for corresponding probes are shown in Fig.

 where they are compared with the spectra from the VALIANT experiment and
 another simulation of same kind but addition that it includes the wind
 tunnel installation.
 The latter as mentioned additionally includes lateral side plates and the
 converging duct which issues a jet, increasing the fidelity of the simulation
 towards the experiment.
 The comparison of results show a good performance of the numerical framework
 in capturing the far-field tones and the broadband characteristic slat
 noise.
 For an observer at 
\begin_inset Formula $-90^{o}$
\end_inset

 at the suction side of the airfoil, the prediction obtains the peak at
 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

, and the higher harmonics of the fundamental which is at 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,Hz$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the first Rossiter tone for this case according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Terracol2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For the fundamental tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,Hz$
\end_inset

, the experimental spectrum also misses the first tone primarily due to
 the fact that at frequencies of 
\begin_inset Formula $800\,Hz$
\end_inset

 and below, the installation noise dominates the acoustic field in the experimen
tal setup.
 In addition, the fundamental tone has a lower SPL component that hardly
 peaks out of the main spectrum as a small hump.
 This suggests that the source radiation might be strongly distorted by
 the local large eddies resulting in a flattening and broadening of the
 associated peak
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Clair2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless, the hump is visible at the upstream microphone on the pressure
 side, corresponding to Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $9$
\end_inset

 at observer angle 
\begin_inset Formula $135^{o}$
\end_inset

 as seen in Fig.

.
 Furthermore, we demonstrate in a subsequent chapter using a slightly adjusted
 position of the slat that this first peak can in fact be captured with
 stronger power levels in the same simulation setup and installation effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the first main tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

, which is the second Rossiter tone, the simulation faithfully reproduces
 the experimental frequency.
 However, the measured sound level is considerably higher at this frequency,
 which is not captured by the free stream simulation.
 In comparison, for the simulation that includes the installation geometries,
 especially the lateral side plates, the prediction leads to a better matching
 of the sound level.
 This suggests that the amplification of this tone can be due to the effect
 of the lateral side plates.
 Indeed, a spanwise resonance can be reasonably suspected to be present
 in the experiment.
 The experiment was designed with a span-to-chord ratio of 1, leading to
 separation between the plates to be 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3\,m$
\end_inset

.
 The fundamental tone for resonance between the plates is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{S0}=572\,Hz$
\end_inset

 whose second harmonic is at 
\begin_inset Formula $1716\,Hz$
\end_inset

.
 This is close to the 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the first harmonic of the cavity resonance.
 Furthermore, while comparing with the simulation that includes the spanwise
 lateral plates, both wall pressure recording and the farfield spectra show
 that the first tone obtained in the installed case is amplified with respect
 to the free stream configuration and hence reaches better agreement with
 the experiment.
 This supports the assumption that the disparity of the first tone is not
 an inaccuracy due to the simulation methodology but has a physical background.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Interestingly, in the further chapters of this thesis, this disparity is
 also explained further as due to the stronger development of the centrifugal
 effect of the cove recirculation in the case of a cleaner spanwise flow
 in the free-stream simulation.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For higher frequencies, the spectra downstream of the airfoil on pressure
 side, i.e.
 Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, shows a better agreement.
 Microphones facing the suction side register higher levels for the frequencies
 above 
\begin_inset Formula $10\,kHz$
\end_inset

 which are possibly due to sources on the suction side of the HLD.
 Both turbulence ejection from the slat and its impingement on to the suction
 side of the airfoil leads to generation of high frequency noise.
\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, in the experiment, it is possible that the high frequency noise
 is attenuated by the presence of the jet shear layer and hence lower sound
 levels for the higher frequencies at farfield observer.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The obtained agreement between the simulation in free flow condition and
 wind tunnel experiment is hence reasonable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, as mentioned, the spanwise extent of airfoil is not the same
 in both experiment and simulation.
 For the experiment, the distance between lateral side plates is kept as
 1 chord length, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $C=0.3\,m$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand the simulation uses a chord length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.66C=0.2\,m$
\end_inset

.
 Theoretically, the experiment is designed to isolate a region between the
 plates which is unaffected by the boundary layer and the corner flow formed
 at the junction of side plates and the airfoil.
 But an exact estimation of what length along the span is effectively free
 from this disturbance and hence acoustically effective is not possible
 from the available data.
 Hence a correction of the sound level corresponding to the spanwise length
 difference can not be considered.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nevertheless, since the exact spanwise length that is acoustically active
 in the experiment is ambiguous, such a calculation is not trivial.

 to first isolate the vortices.
 The Q-criterion is defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Q & =\frac{1}{2}\left((\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})^{2}+|\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\Omega}}|_{2}^{2}-|\mathbf{S}|_{2}^{2}\right)

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

 is the instantaneous velocity vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

 is the strain rate tensor or symmetric part of the velocity gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$
\end_inset

 is the vorticity tensor or the anti-symmetric part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $|.|_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the Frobenius norm.
 The Q-criterion serves as a scalar which represents relative magnitude
 of the vorticity component as opposed to the strain rate.
 In the volume occupied by a vortex, the vortex core has a strong vorticity
 component with minimal strain (hence a larger Q-value) and vice-versa on
 the exterior.
 Hence, by choosing a suitable Q-criteria and obtaining the isocontours
 of the same, vortex structures can be identified given the 3D unsteady
 velocity field.
 To use the same, we use the internal calculator of the ProLB solver to
 record the Q-values along with the unsteady velocity field and extract
 the isocontours using the visualization software ParaView.

The selection of Q-criterion depends on the application and a good visualization
 is obtained by iterative refinement.
 For our application, the Q-value of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.4\times10^{8}$
\end_inset

 was found to isolate the vortices in the flow as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 As an additional aid in visualization, we also use one additional Q-value
 which is 
\begin_inset Formula $70%\ensuremath{\%}
$
\end_inset

 higher.
 This allow to visualize the exterior of the spanwise rollers in addition
 to their inner vortex core.
 The coloring of the isosurface aid in identification of dynamics associated
 with the vortex.
 Here we color the same using the vorticity value which aids in identifying
 the core from the exterior surface.
 The spanwise vorticity behavior can then be isolated by setting the transparenc
y settings in order to selectively highlight the structure based on the
 vorticity component on the iso-contours.
 By using the spanwise vorticity as the coloring criteria and for transparency,
 the spanwise rollers shed from the slat cusp can be clearly identified
 as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 As expected, the spanrollers can be noted to have a strong spanwise coherent
 vorticity in the the vicinity of the slat cusp with progressive dispersion
 until the mid shear layer where the sense of curvature of the shear layer
 reverses.
 By sense of curvature we refer to the fact that the low speed recirculation
 region is on the concave side of the mean shear layer.
 Once the sign of curvature changes, i.e.
 the low speed flow is on the convex side of the curvature, the spanwise
 vortices can be noticed to disintegrate strongly by generation of smaller
 streamwise vortices primarily formed from the periphery of the spanwise
 structures, leading to the ejection of majorly streamwise vortices through
 the slat gap as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 It must be mentioned that in addition to the streamwise vortices, this
 case also has comparatively similar, although less amount of residual spanwise
 vorticity that passes through the slat gap.
 This residual spanwise vorticity is a necessary component for the generation
 of the aeroacoustic phenomena since the streamwise vortices are far less
 efficient than spanwise coherent vortices to generate acoustic waves due
 to trailing edge scattering

\end_inset

, made available as the supplementary document to this thesis, reveal that
 the process of generation of the streamwise vortices in the current case
 is particularly near and after the region where the curvature of the mean
 shear layer switches signs.
 This fact however does not allow us to clearly state that the transition
 of vorticity is definitively due to the effect of curvature.
 This is due to the fact that the region near the slat gap is a region of
 both streamwise acceleration and deceleration of the mean flow.
 The acceleration is due to the nozzle like shape of the region leading
 to the slat gap while the deceleration is caused by the stagnation region
 due to the impingement.
 The area of impingement region generates a zone of stagnation for the mean
 flow which further reduces the area available for the flow to exit, aggravating
 the nozzle effect of the geometry further.
 This complex interaction of the dynamic forces of the fluid hence makes
 it difficult to state that the vorticity transition is definitively driven
 by the curvature effect alone.
 Nevertheless, it is clear that the major source of the streamwise vortices
 is by the transition from the spanwise coherent structures along the later
 stages of the curved shear layer.
 Additionally, the curved wall of the inner slat is susceptible to the well-know
n Görtler instability of concavely curved boundary layers

, and are potentially contributing to the generation of streamwise structures
 in the recirculation particularly close to the slat cusp whose inner wall
 has a strong curvature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another notable feature of the unsteady flow is the uneven distribution
 of the recirculation vortices inside the cove region as seen in both Fig.

.
 The streamwise vortices which are more populous tend to be sparse in the
 region close to the mid trajectory of shear layer and at the center of
 recirculation whereas the density is higher along the curved inner wall
 of the slat.
 The streamwise vortices that reach the impingement location are inevitability
 stretched along the wall due to the streamwise accelerated ejection and
 the stretched vortices disintegrate into smaller vortices as they enter
 the recirculation.
 These smaller vortices then move along the wall and experience the centrifugal
 force due to the curved streamline of the recirculation.
 The centrifugal force hence explains the tendency of the vortices to stay
 in the outer periphery of the cove recirculation causing sparsity near
 the centre of recirculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The recirculating streamwise structures also reach the slat cusp by moving
 along the inner slat wall.
 These structures can be noted to interfere with the shear layer in the
 region near the slat cusp and also in the early shear layer.
 The structures then interfere with the spanwise vortices accelerating the
 generation of more streamwise vortices in the process.
 This also aggravates the fact that the streamwise vortices are sparser
 in the mid-region of the slat shear layer since a major portion of the
 recirculated streamwise vortices are entrained into the shear layer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vortex stretching happening at the trailing edge is also worthy of further
 mention.
 The impinging vortices in the shear layer is a mix of streamwise and spanwise
 vortices with streamwise vortices in larger proportion.
 The latter majorly wind around and form ladder structures together with
 the spanwise structures.
 Near the wall at impingement, the streamwise vortices become stronger and
 assimilate to larger structures, and, as they impinge, the streamwise structure
s are elongated in both the forward and backward directions, towards the
 ejected and recirculated directions respectively.
 Here the stretching is stronger in the downstream direction through the
 slat gap.
 The streamwise vortices in the slat wall are also continuously replenished
 by incoming vortices and as they interact with the wall as they tend to
 roll along wall in the spanwise direction.
 This leads to counter rotating vortices coalescing to form large counter-rotati
ng vortex pairs.
 These counter rotating vortex pairs can be visualized by using a diverging
 colourmap that highlights the streamwise vorticity in opposing directions
 as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The ejected counter rotating vortices and residual smaller streamwise vortices
 are then flushed on to the suction side of the main element.
 The counter rotating pairs often undergo further instability to form helical
 structures before impinging with the suction side wall on main element
 and can noticed in Fig.

\begin_layout Standard
The mean streamlines ejected from the trailing edge location need not necessaril
y directly graze the main element.
 However, in the unsteady dynamics, the ejected vortices tend to have an
 unsteady oscillation which redirects the ejected vortices to have a flapping
 motion towards and away from the main element suction wall.
 This low frequency oscillation also leads to oscillation of the reattachment
 point of the ejected streamwise vortices on the main element.

 layer trajectory representing the convection of vortices shed periodically
 from the cusp.
 Accompanied by their impingement on the wall near TE, the oscillating pressure
 field also exerts its influence over to the leading edge of the main element.
 Hence the hydrodynamic pressure in the slat gap has periodic fluctuations
 synchronized with the pressure fluctuations due to the convected vortices.
 From the 2D visualization at mid-span, the pressure inside the cove region
 also appears to have an oscillating component of considerably lower frequency
 than other stronger fluctuations of smaller length scales.
 From such a distribution of the periodic pressure fluctuation, it is hence
 expected that the shear layer modes would be particularly dominant in a
 model order reduction techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
 (POD) or Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD).
 However, since these fluctuations are purely hydrodynamic, an inference
 of the acoustic interactions in the slat cove would still be difficult
 unless the hydrodynamic and acoustics modes are explicitly segregated.

The unsteady velocity field can shed further light on the three-dimensionality
 of the flow which is not evident from the pressure fields.
 But before elaborating on this, we first plot the unsteady velocity components
 on a colormap suited to highlight the macro flow features outside recirculation
 zone.
 As seen in Fig.

, the velocity magnitude highlights the flow topology as the fluid accelerates
 through the slat gap.
 The ambient/inlet velocity of the simulation is at 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{0}=50\thinspace m/s$
\end_inset

, which is accelerated upto a maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $105\,m/s$

, it can be noticed that the major unsteadiness is confined to a region
 close to the slat TE while the a larger area of the slat gap maintains
 a steady flow.
 This suggest that the ejected vortices, which are understood to be majorly
 streamwise structures, tend to primarily graze the surface of the slat
 trailing edge and the leading edge wall of the main element experience
 a smoother flow.
 The unsteady velocity components also tend to suggest uneven distribution
 inside the slat cove and are generally consistent with the effects of flow
 redirection through slat gap from the pressure side.
 This can be noticed in the broader distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{X}$

Time-averaged flow fields

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Given that the unsteady dynamics has an array of interesting features worthy
 of further exploration, it is important to understand the time-averaged
 fields in tandem.
 The mean flow field convects the fluid and its vortices to establish the
 macro-flow features like the accelerated flow through the slat gap and
 the recirculation region.
 Within this configuration, the unsteadiness can be thought to be introduced
 by generation of vorticity due to the presence of slat cusp or the shear
 layer.
 These vortices then develop unsteady dynamics which leads to the aeroacoustics.
 Hence the vortex dynamics itself is intrinsically first determined by the
 established mean flow.

 This suction peak enhances the lift performance of the wing.
 Looking more closely on to the slat cove, the visualization is made in
 terms of the primitive variables with a tailored color map in Fig.

.
 The region of impingement is distinctly identifiable as a region of high
 pressure due to the partial stagnation of the flow and hence the reduction
 in the flow area through the slat gap.
 It is also evident that the low pressure core of the cove due to recirculation
 is not exactly at the center of recirculation itself but shifted nearer
 to the shear layer.

 The spanwise velocity is then visualized on this plane with suitable colourmap
 to identify the local sign of spanwise velocity.
 As can be observed, the `spanwise cells', as we like to refer to the region
 of same velocity direction, appear to be stacked periodically with alternating
 signs.
 The magnitude of mean spanwise velocity is close to

 of the free stream velocity,

 These cells are also of length scales of the same order of the spanwise
 domain length, which for the current case of standard slat positioning
 generate a total of 6 cells, or 3 pairs of alternating signs.
 Their average spanwise wavelength is hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{z}=L_{span}/3=0.2/3=0.066\,m$

The cell formations tend to maintain the same cells size along the spanwise
 direction through out the cove region.
 However, the cells are not only modulated in the spanwise direction but
 are arranged into two layers along the length of the shear layer path.

 for the sign of the spanwise velocity, i.e.
 along the shear layer length, the arrangement of the cells are such that
 they oppose in signs between the cells attached to early shear layer and
 later shear layer.

The spanwise modulations and their obscurity in slat noise literature lead
 us to many interesting thoughts of which the following three are worthy
 of mention here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First is that the alternating time-averaged spanwise velocity means that
 there exist static nodal planes towards which the flow can converge and
 diverge from.
 Those planes whose both sides have spanwise velocity such that it decreases
 from positive to negative along the spanwise direction and hence have the
 flow directed towards the plane will be referred to as the `converging
 plane'.
 The other type of planes where the spanwise velocity increases from negative
 to positive necessitating the flow to diverge from the plane are the `diverging
 planes'.
 Since these planes act as sources and sinks for the spanwise dynamics,
 they must facilitate the interaction of the spanwise dynamics with the
 2-dimensional dynamics in the streamwise direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Second is that if such nodal planes exist, it is necessary that there must
 exist a mechanism to redistribute the fluid from the converging planes
 and to replenish the diverging planes continuously to establish a steady
 dynamics.
 Here, we have already seen that the recirculating small scale streamwise
 vortices are absorbed into the shear layer in regions near the mid trajectory.
 This suggest that for a converging plane, the mechanism to redistribute
 the fluid is by entertainment of flow along with the streamwise structures
 into the shear layer, which must also lead to higher concentration(spanwise)
 of streamwise structures at the locations of the converging planes.
 There must also be a lower concentration of the streamwise structures in
 the diverging planes.
 Nevertheless, this may not be a phenomena easily observed in a largely
 turbulent state at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=10^{6}$
\end_inset

 with constant generation, distortion, and redistribution of vorticity,
 as in the slat cove.

The driving factor for the spanwise modulations should be the result of
 a dynamic instability either due to the shear layer geometry or due to
 the recirculating flow.
 Similar spanwise modulations are documented for flow over a backward facing
 step by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Their work categorically demonstrated the existence of large scale spanwise
 modulations in the shear layer due to the presence of a backward facing
 step, and argues that the spanwise modulations are the result of an absolute
 convective instability owing to the closed loop streamline in the recirculation
 bubble leading to generation of steady spanwise modes.
 The eigen functions identified in their work using the linear stability
 analysis of a simplified flow configuration, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:barkleyspanmodes"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, predicts the spanwise wavelength with same order as that of the cavity
 depth.
 This is consistent with the observation that the spanwise cells in the
 slat cove have a wavelength with same order as the slat chord.
 On comparing the rectangular flow cavity with the slat cove, the cavity
 depth is analogous to the diameter of the recirculating cove flow, and
 this diameter is approximately the slat chord.
 Their study also suggest a critical Reynolds number, although at a low
 range of 
\begin_inset Formula $Re_{c}=748$
\end_inset

, from which the spanwise modulations are dominant and this critical Reynolds
 number is also argued to be decreased when a lateral side wall is present.
 In the case of simulations with spanwise periodic conditions mimicking
 an infinite spanwise domain, the critical Reynolds number is also increased.
 The case of slat cove dynamics is at a Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

 based on the mean flow and if considering the flow inside the cove region,
 taking the mean velocity to be 
\begin_inset Formula $20\,m/s$
\end_inset

, and the characteristic length scale to be the slat chord, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}=0.039\,m$
\end_inset

, corresponding Reynolds number is at 
\begin_inset Formula $54000$
\end_inset

.
 This regime is still two orders of magnitude higher than that required
 to trigger the convective instability.
 The presence of spanwise walls are also of much importance for the slat
 cove flow as well, since, in our simulations we employ periodic conditions,
 and in experimental studies the lateral side walls are necessary to support
 the HLD mockup in the wind tunnel.
 Hence, drawing parallels between the fact that the flow over a backward
 facing step is much similar to the shear layer geometry of the slat cusp,
 particularly due to the fact that the slat cove also has one side bounded
 by a shear layer and both have a recirculation bubble in which the spanwise
 modes tend to dominate, we suspect the same mechanism is also in action
 in the slat cove dynamics.

 For the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Neary1987"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, three regimes of flow for an open rectangular cavity based on the Reynold's
 number was identified.
 In the first, there is a strong interaction of the shear layer with the
 recirculating vortex inside the cavity.
 In a second regime of higher Reynolds number, the interaction leads to
 intermittent behavior leading to a bursting phenomena where the recirculating
 vortex tends to oscillate in size leading to it bursting through the shear
 layer to release vorticity.
 While doing so, the flow is said to be strongly turbulent.
 In the third regime typically at 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=33500$
\end_inset

, (for our low speed cove recirculation, 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=54000$
\end_inset

), the bursting oscillations and associated pressure oscillations become
 more frequent but irregular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the later work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the rectangular cavities were further analyzed using three-dimensional
 global instability analysis to show that the spanwise instability wavelength
 scales are proportional to the cavity depth.
 The resulting spanwise modulated flow also develop oscillations that can
 induce a low frequency pulsation of the recirculating vortex.
 This frequency was deduced to have one order of magnitude lower than the
 Rossiter oscillations.
 The dependence of the growth rate of the spanwise modes with Reynolds number
 was also identified along with a critical value that would trigger the
 formation of the spanwise modes.
 However, the most interesting argument made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 was that the spanwise instability was a result of the curvature of the
 flow, i.e.
 the curved streamline of the recirculating vortices in the cavity would
 lead to a centrifugal instability that is different from the Rossiter oscillati
ons and the Görtler type instability that occurs on curved boundary walls.
 This argument finds its strength from the fact that the location of strongest
 spanwise modulation is in the region of strong curvature of the recirculation
 bubble on the downstream corner of the cavity.
 The spanwise modulated recirculation vortex would develop also a low frequency
 oscillation, and this additional oscillations can interfere with the Rossiter
 modes to modulate both its frequency and peak amplitudes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
That being noted on the spanwise mode formations, the same argument, along
 with the fact that for both the shear layer on a backward facing step and
 the recirculation streamline in open cavity flows have, in common, a curved
 streamline with one side bounded by a shear layer, we choose to investigate
 the case of slat cove dynamics in terms its peculiarities arising from
 curved streamline path of its shear layer.
 In line with this hypothesis, the behavior of a curved shear layer was
 also studied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 His work studied the linear inviscid hydrodynamic stability of a slightly
 curved free shear layer.
 The study compared the cases of a stably curved and unstably curved shear
 layer identifying sensitivity of the flow to the addition of curvature
 to an already present shear layer.
 The formation of Görtler vortices was identified as a possible reason for
 the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs while
 the unstably curved regime is present.
 The work also provides a non-dimensional parameter, the curvature Richardson
 number, to quantify the effect an accelerated generation of streamwise
 vortices and will be used for comparison in our study as well.

From the above-mentioned array of ideas, we tend to theorize that the slat
 cove dynamics at the current Reynolds number has the following features
 and explanations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The slat shear layer formed due to the difference of velocity between the
 free-stream and the recirculation vortex leads to the canonical Kelvin-Helmholt
z (K-H) instability as well identified in the literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Terracol2016,Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The saturation of K-H instability leads to the generation of 2-dimensional
 spanwise coherent structures being shed periodically from the cusp.
 If these vortices were to be convected in a straight line path, their behavior
 would only have the peculiarities of a vortex convected through an accelerated
 flow.
 However, since the established mean flow is such that the streamlines are
 curved along with the shear layer to facilitate flow through the slat gap,
 the vortices also follow a curved trajectory.
 This curvature of the streamline necessarily have a mean diameter of curvature
 similar in magnitude to the slat chord length.
 The spanwise coherent vortices which undergo such strong curvature experience
 an additional centrifugal force.
 Here, the pressure distribution inside the slat cove is lower than the
 pressure outside the cove region due to the fact that the region outside
 the slat cove is at the pressure side of the main element and is affected
 by presence of stagnation point on the main-element.
 Hence, the normal pressure gradient along the shear layer is positive along
 a radius of curvature of the shear layer with center of rotation inside
 the cove.
 This radial pressure gradient opposes the centrifugal force thereby requiring
 a balancing of these forces to enable a stable flow.
 This is the classical requirement for a dynamic instability to occur where
 two opposing forces which are supposed to be balanced are, in reality,
 not exactly and dynamically balanced, thereby leading to large growth rate
 for certain class of perturbations.
 The curved shear layer is hence susceptible to the curvature instability
 leading to the typical steady spanwise modes primarily attached to the
 shear layer as described by

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, it can be noticed that for the early part of the shear layer, the lower
 velocity flow is on the concave side of the shear layer curvature.
 This is a stable curvature since according to Rayleigh criteria the equilibrium
 is stable against curvature instability if the angular momentum decreases
 radially outward
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rayleigh1917"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In early shear layer, the streamline velocity is increasing radially outward
 from the cove center and hence the curvature instability is stabilized.
 Furthermore, as inferred by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the initial K-H instability may also be stabilized partially leading to
 a reduced growth rate of the streamwise perturbations suggesting a delayed
 spanwise vortex generation due to the effect of curvature.
 Hence, in this regime, the major noticeable dynamics are a delayed generation
 of K-H vortices as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 together with the large spanwise modulations arising from the convective
 instability of the recirculation from the suggestion of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As the flow progresses downstream, the shear layer weakens due to its spreading
 and growth of spanwise vortices.
 Simultaneously, the radius of curvature also decreases to eventually reverse
 its sign.
 Once the sign of curvature reverses and strengthen near the vicinity of
 the slat trailing edge region, i.e., the streamlines curve such that the
 low pressure area of the suction peak on the main element is again on the
 concave side of the streamlines near the slat gap, and the high pressure
 region generated due to the impingement of the shear layer on the slat
 trailing edge is on its convex side.
 This reversed configuration of pressure gradient is again opposing the
 centrifugal acceleration facilitating curvature instability again.
 However, unlike the early shear layer, the velocity field can be noticed
 to have the high velocity stream on the concave side of the curvature.
 This according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is the unstably curved configuration and satisfy the Rayleigh criterion
 to have a radially decreasing angular momentum.
 Hence the shear layer now develops a strong centrifugal instability leading
 to the generation of streamwise oriented counter rotating vortex pairs.
 This generation of small scale structures are strongly accelerated by the
 presence of the ingested vortices from the recirculation region.
 It must be clearly noted that the regime of flow near the slat trailing
 edge is the asymptotic case for the linear stability analyzed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 whose conclusions are only directly valid for a curved free shear layer
 with small curvature.
 The effective range of curvature Richardson numbers for their analysis
 is of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 where for the slat shear layer, these are on average two orders of magnitude
 higher as we show in the upcoming session.
 Hence, for the later part of the shear layer near the impingement location
 and flow through the slat gap, the major phenomena is the curvature instability
 driven by a considerably lower radius of curvature with a mean velocity
 distribution enabling a fully unstable configuration.
 The only noticeable effect is hence the generation of streamwise oriented
 counter rotating vortex pairs which assimilate into larger streamwise vortices
 on the slat trailing edge and are elongated and ejected through the slat
 gap.
 The terminology used in the recent literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wang2019,Wang2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that these are `Görtler like' transition is hence logically valid, although
 there is no curved boundary layer as in the case of the canonical Görtler
 transition that leads to small scale streamwise oriented structures.
 Note that since this is a purely centrifugal instability, meaning that
 this generation of streamwise structures would happen even if there was
 no supply of spanwise coherent vortices in the impinging shear layer, as
 reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wang2021"

\end_inset

.
 Their work demonstrates that at low enough Reynolds numbers, the periodic
 vortex shedding from the slat cusp is suppressed, possibly due to the combined
 effect of the stabilization of K-H instability due to curvature and the
 low Reynolds number, and the only noticeable turbulence generation is that
 of the streamwise vortices near the trailing edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Finally, inside the recirculation, the flow developing spanwise modulation
 was previously unidentified in the literature although it was noticed early
 that the vorticity ejected from the slat gap had spanwise modulations.
 The flow in the cove region was largely analyzed under the assumption that
 it is spanwise homogeneous, and at this point of understanding the cove
 dynamics, it is striking why the prediction of cove flow and related acoustics
 remained elusive from a perfectly predictive modelling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Souza2022"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This we suggest is due to the fact that the three dimensionality of the
 flow due to the spanwise modulation would induce additional oscillations,
 suggestively with frequency one order of magnitude lower than the first
 Rossiter tone, which can modulate the tonal frequencies and the amplitude
 of the peaks as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This tone, or more precisely a broadband hump in the low frequency was
 clearly identified in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, who characterized the same as having a different source mechanism compared
 to other tones.

 turbulent region like that of the slat cove and flow around the airfoil
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, together with the fact that the intermittent bursting phenomena associated
 with oscillation of the recirculation vortex can both significantly broaden
 the frequency bandwidth of fluctuations effected by this mechanism on a
 far-field microphone.
 This broadband hump is also in the low frequency range which is dominated
 by the measurement noise from the experimental setup and noise from the
 shear layer of the open jet wind tunnel adding to their elusiveness.
 Thus when tonal character of slat noise was rightly identified as those
 related to the Rossiter mechanism by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, their modulation mechanism was overlooked due to the assumption of the
 spanwise homogeneity and thereby the choice of methodology for both experimenta
tion and numerical studies so far.

Now, before moving on to further discussion of the unsteady data related
 to the acoustics, we take a light detour to showcase a few additional simulatio
ns to establish that the formation of spanwise modes are not purely an artifact
 of the numerical simulation.
 This is evident from the fact that the same phenomena is observed in both
 flow over a backward facing step

To demonstrate that the formation of spanwise modes is not an artifact of
 the simulation or the spanwise boundary condition applied, we discuss a
 few simulations which have a slightly varied configurations.
 For this first we take the case of simulation of VALIANT HLD geometry which
 has the wind tunnel geometry and the supporting lateral sidewalls included
 in the simulation.
 Then we discuss the simulations where the spanwise length of the domain
 is reduced by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$

, and then a case with only two rectangular plates included to use reflecting
 boundary conditions in the spanwise boundaries as opposed to periodic condition
s used in the standard simulations.
 All these cases are shown to develop the spanwise cells for the time-averaged
 spanwise velocity field.

 As can be noted, the cell formation due to the previously mentioned curvature
 instability is notable in the spanwise velocity distribution near the central
 plane away from the lateral walls.
 However, closer to the walls, the velocity field is more strongly modulated
 with stronger amplitudes than near the center planes.
 Such effects were also noted in the presence of the backward facing steps
 where lateral side walls generate strong three dimensionality for flow
 adjacent to the walls

 However these can be thought to be a separate phenomena since the lateral
 walls of the airfoil also generate additional dynamics due to the problem
 of corner separation for the turbulent boundary layer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cells near the center plane appear to have the same properties as those
 formed in the free flow simulation.
 The modulations are largely attached to the shear layer, and as the shear
 layer developed downstream, the cells inside the recirculation region tend
 to remain attached to the shear layer.
 A separate arrangement of cells with phase inversion is seen to then occupy
 the interior of the cove nearer to the curved inner wall of the slat.
 This new arrangement then develops stronger towards the slat gap but is
 noticeably more distorted due to the end wall effects.
 The nodal planes leading to converging and diverging planes are noticeable
 which suggests that the pulsating mechanism related to the low frequency
 broadband peak can be present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extent of the effect of lateral walls into the interior of the cavity
 in spanwise direction is significant.
 Current simulation suggests that more than 
\begin_inset Formula $80\%$
\end_inset

 of the spanwise extent is affected by the distortion and the curvature
 related flow structure is limited to only 
\begin_inset Formula $20\%$
\end_inset

 of the length.
 This means that curvature related low frequency pulse is considerably weaker
 in the experimental spectra and hence is also not notable.
 It is hence possible that the experiment also has reduced effect of the
 spanwise modulation leading to a reduced modulation of the tonal frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another factor worthy of mention is that in comparison with the VALIANT
 experiment which uses a spanwise length of 1 chord length, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3\,m$
\end_inset

 as the distance between the spanwise plates, the setup for a different
 experiment on the 30P30N HLD geometry by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KamliyaJawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 used a spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\,m$
\end_inset

.
 In terms of the chord to span ratio, VALIANT experiment kept 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{L_{s}}{C_{s}}=1$
\end_inset

, whereas in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

's work, a ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{L_{s}}{C_{s}}=1.42$
\end_inset

 was kept.
 The latter also was designed at a chord based Reynolds number of 
\begin_inset Formula $Re=70000$
\end_inset

.
 The experiment was conducted at the wind tunnel facility at University
 of Bristol and lead to observation of the prominent low frequency hump
 in the spectra corresponding to the first Rossiter mode, and particularly
 with strong intermittency and stochastic character.
 From the influence of the lateral side wall plates that is shown to disrupt
 the spanwise mode formation due to centrifugal instability and the nature
 of its suspected low frequency oscillation, we conjecture that the strength
 of the low frequency hump in the noise spectra will be correlated with
 the availability of sufficient space between spanwise holding plates.
 This can also influence the strength of the tones and can be suspected
 to be the reason for the variation of strength for the alternating narrow
 bands peaks in their far-field observation.
 It is however the general experimenter's wisdom that keeping the spanwise
 distance as high as possible would reduce the three dimensional effect
 of the side wall boundary layer thereby recovering the spanwise homogeneous
 2D flow in the spanwise central plane.
 This is expected from the behavior of wide span cavities as well
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "HamiltonSmith2024"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 But counter-intuitively, this is only disrupting the development of the
 three dimensionality due to the centrifugal instability for the slate cove
 case.
 Further more, the measurement of the turbulent intensity and wall pressure
 spectrum will also be misinformed in the case of similar experiments with
 insufficient spanwise margin since the existence of a nodal plane at the
 spanwise central plane can lead to erroneous observation of either excessive
 or reduced turbulence intensity due to the converging or diverging motion
 of spanwise structures in the cove recirculation region.
 The spanwise modes and their possible oscillations hence provide a reasonable
 explanation for the intrigue upon the quasi-periodic behavior of the Rossiter
 tones in the study by

The mean flow around the airfoil in this case shows a strong deviation from
 the standard case results.
 Here the flow separates early from the leading edge of the main element
 leading edge and is hence stalled.
 The shape of the cove flow is also strongly distorted such that shear layer
 is elongated with a reduced initial curvature near the slat cusp.
 Hence this case is not successful simulation of the aerodynamics in view
 of its fidelity against the experiment, but however is still valid to be
 inspected for the effect of the spanwise condition inside the slat cove.

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the spanwise cut plane across the span still retains the spanwise periodic
 cell formation.
 Here the region inside of the cove region can be seen to have the spanwise
 cells while the region outside of the shear layer region is strongly affected
 by the presence of the wall.
 The spanwise velocity near the spanwise walls are strongly perturbed by
 the boundary layer to have a mean distribution as to direct the flow towards
 the span center.

The outcome of this simulation is two fold: one is that the presence of
 spanwise cells are demonstrated to be independent of the spanwise boundary
 conditions in the simulation for the slat cove region; the second is that
 this cell formations are possible even if there is a strong incoming turbulence
 intensity.
 For the incoming turbulence, it can modify the flow such that airfoil stalls
 at an early angle of attack and also alter the shear layer shape.
 Nevertheless, the recirculation flow generates the centrifugal instability
 inside the cove and hence the spanwise cells are still present.

, the velocity distribution shows little difference in the larger two dimensiona
l features of the flow in the mid-span plane.
 However, the three dimensionality of the cove flow and the formation of

, the spanwise cells are formed in the early part of the shear layer as
 expected from the full span simulation.
 However, for the region corresponding to the later part of the shear layer,
 the spanwise modulation seams to have weakened leading to more homogeneity
 in the flow and reduced spanwise velocity component.
 This induced homogeneity of the flow due to spanwise condition is recognized
 in literature and have served as a criterion to determine the lower bound
 for the spanwise length of simulation domain for numerical studies

 have already studied the VALIANT geometry using different spanwise extent
 to demonstrate the same phenomena.
 For the current case, spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1\,m$
\end_inset

 is hence inferred as insufficient to reproduce the full three dimensionality
 of the flow.
 This leads to the partial formation of the spanwise modulations in the
 early part of the shear layer due to strong curvature of the flow and a
 largely homogeneous spanwise distribution in the rest of the cove region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partial presence of the spanwise cells in a reduced span simulation
 also hints at the fact that the spanwise boundary condition acts only so
 as to induce homogeneity.
 The persistent formation of cell structures in the region of early shear
 layer with strong curvature again suggest that the 3-dimensionality is
 predominantly a centrifugal effect.
 This centrifugal flow is primarily driven by the concave curvature of the
 inner wall of the slat cusp together with the redirection of the flow by
 the incoming ambient flow from upstream.
 Persistence of the spanwise modulation at this region, while induced homogeneit
y dominating in the downstream locations, suggest that the amplification
 of the spanwise mode instability is higher in the region of early shear
 layer compared to other regions in the cove.

 The spanwise cells can be noted to have similar arrangement as in the standard

 However, the spanwise wavelength has been reduced by a factor of

 where the spanwise wavelength is of the same order as that of the cavity

 Here the scaling of the slat chord, and hence the cavity depth, is also

\end_inset

 with respect to the standard geometry, and hence is now 
\begin_inset Formula $0.026\,m$

 Correspondingly, the spanwise wavelength also undergoes down scaling.
 By a linear factor of

The Reynolds number of the flow is also scaled by a factor of

\end_inset

 due to the scaling of characteristic length.
 However, the inlet velocity is maintained at 
\begin_inset Formula $50\,m/s$

 Here the magnitude of curvature is amplified by a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{3}{2}$

 and hence higher the effect of centrifugal destabilization.
 For this case the observed spanwise wavelength

\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{z}=\lambda_{z}/C_{s}^{*}=1.5$

\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the new slat chord.
 Note that for the full span case, it maintained 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{z}=1.785$
\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless, the final selection of wave number is constrained by the
 fact that the spanwise boundaries have a periodic conditions thereby necessitat

 Counting this in, the given cases validates the suggestion of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 that the spanwise wavelength is proportional to the cavity depth and also
 that the mode formation is primarily driven by the centrifugal instability
 mechanism similar to cavity flows.
 Since this phenomenon was only discovered during the exercise of this thesis,
 we did not conduct a parametric study to understand the variation of the
 span length, along with spanwise domain length.
 Such an investigation and also a model for the prediction of cell formation
 in the particular case of slat cove flow by using linear stability analysis
 can be an interesting avenue for further investigation.

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of the mean flow inside the cove region and drawing parallels
 from the literature, particularly from that on the spanwise modulation
 of curved flows in cases of flow past a backward facing step, open cavity
 flows, and lid-driven cavity flows, it suggests to investigate the effect
 of i) the three dimensionality and ii) streamline curvature in the shear
 layer and recirculation region.
 The curvature of the streamline in the shear layer may also trigger a `Görtler'
 like transition leading to the generation of counter-rotating small-scale
 streamwise structures.
 Both these effects are fundamental to the slat noise generation mechanism
 whose tonal characteristics are necessarily influenced by the coherence
 of the impinging spanwise coherent vortices.
 Hence, to understand the curvature effects more thoroughly and to quantitativel
y understand its implications on the shear layer development, we attempt
 to characterize the mean streamlines by utilizing the mean field recording
 available from the LBM simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean streamlines can be obtained from the time-averaged velocity field.
 For our purpose, we use a constant time stepping and the mean 2-dimensional
 velocity as the gradient field as inputs to a Runge-Kutta integrator.
 Here, since we assume that the flow features in the spanwise direction
 are primarily driven by the streamline curvature in the mid-span 2D plane,
 the streamwise and cross-flow component of the velocity field is used to
 study the streamline in their 2D plane and omit the contribution of spanwise
 velocity component.
 For the Runge-Kutta integrator, we use the classical fourth order RK4 formulati
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean flow data is obtained on the Cartesian grid of the simulation.
 However, this grid is not suitable to obtain a continuous streamline and
 hence the velocity field need to be interpolated in order to obtain the
 velocity value at a given query point for the RK integrator.
 For this interpolation we use the Clough-Tocher interpolation scheme provided
 with the scientific computing package SciPy.
 The interpolation scheme finds the three neighboring points of the query
 point and uses a piece-wise interpolating Bezier polynomial with order
 of accuracy upto third degree.
 Since the procedure is computationally inexpensive and over resolution
 is used by setting the time stepping to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times10^{-7}s$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The streamline can thus be recovered for any selection of the source point
 in the flow field.
 However, to select a suitable point that would allow capturing the mean
 trajectory of the spanwise coherent vortices, the mean velocity magnitude
 distribution on a straight line across the shear layer near the slat cusp
 is used as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The point at the bottom of the dip in velocity magnitude correspond to
 the point immediately downstream of the slat cusp and this point is selected
 as the source point for the streamline integrator.

The obtained streamline is then used to quantitatively analyze the streamline
 curvature.
 Geometrically, the local curvature of a streamline is defined as the rate
 of variation of a unit tangent vector direction with respect to the arc-length.
 This definition allows to calculate the Radius of curvature in different
 forms as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
R & =\left\Vert \frac{d\vec{T}}{ds}\right\Vert =\frac{\frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}}{\left[1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{2}\right]^{\frac{3}{2}}}
\end{align*}

where, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the Radius of Curvature, which is the reciprocal of the measure of curvature
, 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\frac{1}{R}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the path length.
 Here, since we obtained the coordinates of the points of the streamline
 path, we choose the formula 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
R & =\left[\left(\frac{\partial^{2}x}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\partial^{2}y}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}\right]^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $ds$
\end_inset

 is the differential arc length computed as the first order gradient of
 flow path-length obtained by cumulative sum of the individual Runge-Kutta
 integrated steps for the path-length.
 The numerical computation of the local Radius of Curvature as a function
 of the streamwise location on the shear layer for the standard geometry
 is shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:localcurvature"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The calculation of gradients is particularly noisy for the calculation
 of the second order derivative along the streamline due to the interpolation
 and hence an additional averaging is applied using a moving window for
 the calculation of curvature.
 This averaging, with a window size of 100 points, reduces the numerical
 noise and delivers a smoother calculation in the early shear layer and
 also in the downstream where the mean velocity field is less converged
 due to the low frequency oscillations of the cove flow.
 For calculations using the second order gradient we report only the smoothed
 version of the obtained quantities.

The measure of curvature is the inverse of the Radius of Curvature, R.
 The shear layer shape necessarily follows a path whose mean curvature is

At the impingement location, the mean streamline can have two trajectories,

 in their spanwise coherence in this region and the flow consists majorly

As shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the deceleration on the streamline is far from uniform.
 The flow is first accelerated along the streamline in the initial region
 of the vortex shedding and as the streamline curvature decreases in the
 intermediate region, the flow is accelerated.
 Before the impingement near the wall, the stagnation causes a region of
 strong deceleration.
 This stagnation of the mean flow generates the necessary pressure gradient
 required to counter act the centrifugal force generated by the curvature
 of the flow.
 However, when the angular momentum decreases radially across the streamlines,
 the centrifugal force can be in excess of the established pressure gradient.
 This imbalance is the cause for the centrifugal instability.
 These perturbations then allow exchange of momentum along the radial direction
 by the transport of fluid thereby balancing the deficit in the pressure
 gradient to counteract the centrifugal force.
 This rapid generation of streamwise vortices is also enhanced by the degenerati
on of spanwise coherent vortices which have already entrained a portion
 of the recirculating streamwise vortices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The location of maximum deceleration relative to the flow geometry is marked

.
 The position is not exactly on the slat trailing edge but slightly upstream,
 the exact location being dependent on the choice of streamline.
 Nevertheless, the marked position is the location of the maximum deceleration
 experienced by a fluid particle moving along the streamline and is hence
 the location of maximum momentum transfer.
 In view of the theory that impingement of vortices is responsible for the
 generation of acoustic waves that modulate the K-H shedding frequency at
 the cusp and thereby select the tonal noise frequency, this location must
 correspond to the length of the shear layer that predicts the tonal noise
 frequency.
 To understand this further we look at the actual velocity distribution
 along the streamline and compute the time of travel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time required for the spanwise eddy to reach the location of maximum
 deceleration can be obtained as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{S}=\int^{S}\frac{ds}{V(s)}$
\end_inset

.
 The total time is then obtained as sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{S}$
\end_inset

 and the acoustic propagation time from the location of impingement to the
 source point of the streamline.
 This calculation leads to total time of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.213ms$
\end_inset

 corresponding to a frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $824Hz$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

To compare this frequency to the theoretical model, the tone prediction
 formula of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{n}=n\frac{U_{\infty}}{L_{a}}\cdot\frac{1}{\mathcal{M}+\frac{\alpha_{l}}{\kappa_{v}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the acoustic path length, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{l}$
\end_inset

 is the ratio of length of the shear layer to the acoustic path between
 the impingement location and the cusp and 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{v}$
\end_inset

 is the ratio of vortex convection velocity of vortices along the shear
 layer to the free stream velocity.
 Here, the vortex convection velocity is not calculable from a mean flow
 solution and for our study we resort to the value obtained for the same
 case by Terracol et al., i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{v}=0.79$
\end_inset

.
 Based on the location of maximum deceleration, the acoustic path length
 is obtained as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{a}=0.0326m$
\end_inset

, and the vortex path length along the shear layer as 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{v}=0.0387m$
\end_inset

, leading to 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{l}=1.187$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting fundamental tone corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}=928Hz$
\end_inset

 and the multiples being 
\begin_inset Formula $[1856,2784,3712,4640,\text{ and }5568]$

 Hz.
 These frequencies are higher than the experimental tone frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $[1771,2655,3540,4425,\text{ and }5310]$
\end_inset

, and hence suggest that the location of maximum deceleration is a location
 slightly too early than the actual location of the acoustic generation.
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

's formula is highly sensitive to the computation of the shear layer path
 length, and hence on the location of the acoustic generation, lending high
 level of uncertainity in the tone calculation using this method.
 Moreover, for the same calculation, a correction of the convection velocity
 factor to 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{v}=0.75$

 His analogy of the streamline curvature with a stratified flow under the
 effect of buoyancy led to formulation of representative parameters.
 One of these, pertinent to interpretation of the slat shear layer, is the
 flux Richardson number.
 By the analogy, for flow along a curved streamline, it is the ratio of
 turbulent kinetic energy production between the radial direction and the
 streamwise direction, i.e.
\end_layout

 while studying the stability of curved free shear layers in small curvature
 regime.
 The generation of vorticity in the streamwise direction, in their perspective,
 is an effect of the diffusion of the turbulent velocity perturbation into
 the streamwise direction led by the effect of the centrifugal force and
 hence arises from the requirement of inviscid stability.
 The flux Richardson number aids in quantifying the effect of this imposed
 vorticity transfer by taking into account the effect of the centrifugal
 force acting on the flow and also the local vorticity thickness by incorporatin
g the radial streamwise-velocity gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial n}$
\end_inset

.
 In this regard, we extrapolate the existing perspective as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well understood from the literature that the streamline curvature
 along a shear layer can lead to additional instability arising from the
 centrifugal effects.
 This leads to the generation of streamwise vortices across a wide range
 of Reynolds numbers.
 The effect of curvature is such that there is a generation of streamwise
 vorticity which is cumulative in the sense that this accumulation of streamwise
 vorticity happens as long as the Rayleigh criteria holds, i.e.
 with a reduction of the angular momentum radially outward from the center
 of curvature.
 The cumulative effect of this curvature can be captured by the total transfer
 of momentum due to the additional centrifugal force in action, or as the
 work done by the same.
 The instantaneous momentum transfer, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{c}$
\end_inset

, effected by the centrifugal force while the fluid traverses a curved path
 
\begin_inset Formula $ds$
\end_inset

 with a local radius of curvature 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, traversing with a streamwise velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, is equivalent to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d\Theta_{c}=\frac{U^{2}}{R}\frac{ds}{U}=\frac{U}{R}ds
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is the velocity component along the streamline, and in the vectorial sense
 of the centrifugal force, the direction of this momentum transfer is invariant
 as the direction radially outward from the center of curvature.
 The resulting term 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U}{R}$
\end_inset

 is hence the effective density of total momentum transfer due to the centrifuga
l force along the path length.
 Thus the curvature Richardson number of the form in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:curvatureRich"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 effectively capture the effect of the centrifugal force in its momentum
 transfer leading to the generation of streamwise vorticity.
 The same term is used in the curvature Richardson number together with
 the cross-stream velocity gradient, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}$
\end_inset

.
 In case that the shear layer has a strong velocity gradient such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}>>\frac{U}{R}$
\end_inset

, as in the early part of the slat shear layer, or in the case of a plane
 shear layer, the curvature Richardson number approaches zero.
 However, in the region where the shear layer weakens, and the curvature
 is finite such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U}{\partial R}<<\frac{U}{R}$
\end_inset

, the curvature Richardson number will tend to increase and saturate at
 2.
 For the case of applying the linearized equations to study effects of a
 slightly curved free shear layers, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 used a Richardson number of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, for the case of slat shear layer, the curvatures are atleast two
 order of magnitude higher and hence is expected to be highly non-linear
 in its dynamics.

 The Richardson number can be seen to have a low value in the early shear
 layer due to the high value for the strain rate.
 As the shear layer spreads, the curvature Richardson number tends to increase,
 suggesting the strong momentum transfer due to the centrifugal force.
 In the mid-region, the curvature reduces as the shear layer inverts its
 direction of the curvature towards the unstable configuration, and the
 Richardson number hence drops.
 Afterwards, the curvature Richardson number increases as the shear layer
 spreads due to growth of the spanwise eddies along with entertainment of
 streamwise vortices.
 The curvature Richardson number then tend to saturate towards 2 in the
 region immediately downstream of the location of maximum deceleration,
 owing to the large value of curvature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The case considered here is the standard geometry with standard position
 of the slat with respect to the airfoil.
 This configuration showed strong presence of the broadband acoustic spectra
 and tonal noise owing to the fact that the spanwise coherence of the shed
 vortices from slat cusp is not fully disintegrated by the time of their
 travel towards the trailing edge.
 This owes to the fact that the curvature Richardson number rises to a strong
 value only near and downstream of the location of maximum deceleration
 suggesting that the flow did not accrue a large enough effect of the centrifuga
l destabilization, as it would have been the case if the flow developed
 a larger curvature Richardson number further upstream of the impingement
 location.
 This means that although the effect of centrifugal instability is substantial
 in generating the streamwise turbulence, it is not sufficient to cause
 a complete degeneration of spanwise coherence to disable the aeroacoustic
 resonance.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Nevertheless, in the vicinity of the impingement location, the process of
 spanwise decoherence must be strongly dominated by the collision processes
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This means that the momentum transfer due to centrifugal force is weaker
 in this particular case when compared to cases whose slat positioning enables
 a higher distribution of Richardson number throughout the shear layer.
 This fact is reflected in the distribution of the curvature Richardson
 in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, since its value is typically low in the region of the early shear layer.
 The flow is also stable towards centrifugal instability due to the stable
 configuration of increasing angular momentum along the radius of curvature.
 The curvature Richardson number rises to a strong value only near and downstrea
m of the location of maximum deceleration suggesting that the flow did not
 accrue largely the effect of the centrifugal force, as it would have been
 the case if the flow developed a larger curvature Richardson number further
 upstream of the impingement location.

That being said, we now define a non-dimensional quantity that allows us
 to compare the effect of curvature for any given geometry of the slat shear
 layer, based only on the shear layer shape and mean flow distribution.
 For this we use a cumulative integral of the Richardson number along the
 shear layer, which can be formally written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M^{*}(l)=\int_{0}^{l}Ri_{f}ds
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 is the length along the streamline through the shear layer.
 For the given standard case, the cumulative curvature Richardson number
 as a function of the shear layer path length is shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cumulativecurvaturerichardson"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For the given case, the cumulative Richardson number is at a value of approxima
tely 0.005 at the location of maximum deceleration.
 The accrual of Richardson number above this value sharply increases in
 the region downstream of location of maximum deceleration and it rises
 to 0.01 suggesting strong generation of the streamwise structures arising
 from the centrifugal effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are two things worth mentioning with regard to analyzing the curvature
 effect in this manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
First is that in the volume of region after the impingement, the effect
 of curvature instability is obviously large across the slat gap.
 However, this region is not only influenced by the curvature but by the
 effect of impingement itself.
 The effect of the latter towards the decoherence process can be assumed
 to be stronger given that it generates strong aerodynamic pressure fluctuations
 and vorticity generation.
 Hence it is not useful to use the curvature Richardson number after the
 location of maximum deceleration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The second is that the effect of curvature is obviously substantial.
 Hence the same can be used to qualitatively understand how the noise efficiency
 will change when shape of the shear layer changes.
 However, this is useful only if the impingement location is sufficiently
 close to the trailing edge with the shear layer shape upstream of impingement
 has variations.
 In such a case, a slower accrual of the curvature Richardson number can
 lead to a higher spanwise coherence of the spanwise eddies responsible
 for exciting the Rossiter mechanism and hence can deliver a strong resonance
 leading to noisy operation.
 In cases with an early impingement, as in the case considered by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 where they used a plug on the slat wall to cause variations in shear layer
 shape, the spanwise coherence will degenerate regardless of the curvature
 effects leading to reduced noise efficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That being said, before moving to a parametric analysis, let us look into
 the acoustics data available from the simulation in detail.
 We do not reiterate the far-field data obtained using FWH computation but

Acoustic perturbations are essentially perturbations of the pressure field
 arising from compressibilty and translate to equivalent density perturbations.
 By the continuity equation, the density perturbation can be written in
 terms of the divergence of the velocity field as
\end_layout

 is called the dilatation field
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Within turbulent flows, the dilatation field has two components due to
 the hydrodynamic and acoustic fluctuations.
 The former are large magnitude perturbations that witness slight hydrodynamic
 compressibilty that might contribute or not to sound radiation whereas
 the latter are small magnitude perturbations that represents the propagation
 of sound.
 Although vastly differing in their order of magnitudes, separating the
 two is still a non-trivial procedure
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 But the emanating acoustic wave fronts can be identified in the region
 outside the turbulent region where sound generation is absent.
 The typical dilatation field around the HLD as obtained from the unsteady
 simulation is shown on the snapshot of Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The wave fronts emitted from the slat cove are identifiable from the dilatation
 field towards both the suction side and the pressure side, latter being
 towards the ground observer.
 The major acoustic source region can be identified as the slat cove and
 the trailing edge of the main-element.
 The trailing edge of this HLD, must be recalled, is obtained by replacing
 a TE flap in order to reduce lift

 The radiation towards the pressure side is seen to radiate from the region
 close to the slat gap, and for the radiation to the suction side, the source
 appears to be located within the slat cove.
 There also exist a region with acoustic shadow in the upstream of the slat
 since the geometry shadows the radiation unless the wave number is small
 enough to enable diffraction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dilatation field also has drawbacks visualizing data on the grids with
 refinement interfaces.
 At the refinement interface, the calculation of derivative introduces numerical
 errors, which are not necessarily unsteady.
 Hence the errors does not necessarily lead to generation of spurious acoustics
 but vitiates the acoustic field visualization.
 An improvement in this regard is hence possible by using an alternative
 definition for dilatation as the density rate.
 For isentropic fluctuations of small amplitudes in an otherwise quiescent
 media, the dilatation can be expressed as the rate of pressure fluctuation
 as

From observing the dynamics of the filtered fields, the following observations
 can be made:
\begin_inset Note Comment
status collapsed

\begin_layout Enumerate
The filtered field corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

 has two dominant lobes near the impingement location as shown in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:filterpressure885"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This is the location of maximum curvature where the streamline curves into
 the recirculation region.
 The two lobes on the either side of the location of impingement has opposite
 polarity and are coupled in their dynamics.
 The node between the two lobes appear to have a stationary location unlike
 a traveling wave for other frequencies.
 This suggest that this mode is not generated by the impinging vortices
 convected by the shear layer, but rather by a feature of the flow dynamics
 that is local to the impingement location.
 This is hence reasoned to be the low frequency steady mode fluctuation,
 as part of the steady spanwise mode found in the mean velocity fields,
 driven by the effect of strong curvature of the streamlines.
 Moreover, the opposing polarity of the two lobes suggest that there exists
 a strong oscillating pressure gradient.
 This pressure gradient leads to oscillation of the impingement location
 of the shear layer leading to a closing and opening of the cavity, which
 is enclosed by the shear layer on one side and the curved slat wall on
 the other side.
 Such an effect drives the fluctuation of the larger hydrodynamic pressure
 mode inside the cavity and due to the amplitude of oscillation will influence
 the vortex shedding frequency leading to a selection of common oscillating
 frequency between them.
 This process can hence be suspected to largely influence the frequency
 selection of the resonance frequencies, in addition to the Rossiter mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Dynamics corresponding to frequencies of other tones show similarities between
 them as shown in Fig.

.
 The tonal frequency reveal that they are traveling waves along the shear
 layer with the lowest frequency having the largest lobes.
 For higher frequencies, the lobes grow smaller, however traverses with
 a constant convection velocity of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $23 m/sm/s$
\end_inset

.
 These are hence attributed to the large scale spanwise coherent structures
 convected along the shear layer inducing their traveling pressure fields
 on to the flow.
 The impingement location instead of having lobes separated by the impingement
 location, have shapes aligned with the ejected streamline.
 These lobes are however present in pairs arranged along the cross flow
 direction suggesting that the mode of fluctuation induce motion of the
 ejected fluid normal to the slat trailing edge wall, and normal to the
 mean streamlines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The dynamics of acoustic waves can also be noted to be strongly coupled
 with large amplitude hydrodynamic oscillations.
 For all frequencies visualized, the acoustic fluctuations near the slat
 trailing edge is notably synchronized with pressure fluctuations of the
 impingement dynamics.
 The radiated wavefronts upstream of slat trailing edge outside the cove
 also have their center precisely at the slat trailing edge.
 For the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $885Hz$
\end_inset

, the center of radiation is more ambiguous due to the fact that the wavelength
 at this frequency is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.38m$
\end_inset

, roughly one order of magnitude higher than the slat chord.
 Hence this tone, along with the other characteristics tones less than approxima
tely 
\begin_inset Formula $9 kHzkHz$
\end_inset

, cannot form a standing wave in the 2D plane of slat cove flow between
 the slat trailing edge and cusp.
 Consequently, the only standing wave possible in the low frequency range
 is the spanwise direction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The tonal wavefronts for the higher frequencies are notably centered at
 the slat trailing edge with a directivity normal to the tangent of the
 upper wall.
 The trailing edge of the VALIANT geometry has a thickness of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.7mm$
\end_inset

 and is hence not exactly a pointed edge as in the case of the cusp.
 The directivity of the lobe agrees well with the observations in the literature
 that the tonal directivities follow dipole behavior, with the axis of the
 dipole normal to the slat wall at trailing edge.
 However, this is only an approximation since only the upper lobe at the
 trailing edge can radiate to the farfield and the lower lobe is partly
 reflected and partly shielded by the presence of the main element.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The hydrodynamic pressure in the slat cove for all tone frequencies of 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

 and above extracted shows a spatially growing wave along the shear layer.
 These waves represent the pressure fluctuation induced by the convected
 vorticity generated near the cusp.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The dynamic visualization of impingement of these spatial waves on the trailing
 edge suggest that they are in-phase with the acoustic source for corresponding
 frequency near the trailing edge for the tones at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

 and above.
 This re-validates the fact that impingement of vortices are responsible
 for the acoustic wave generation and subsequent Rossiter mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The hydrodynamic oscillation at the slat TE for 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,Hz$

 These lobes represent pressure fluctuations that due to the vortex shedding
 and is responsible for the flapping motion of the shear layer at the slat
 TE.

 The probes are activated for the full length of the simulation to monitor

From analyzing the data, the recordings from probes on the leading edge
 of the slat shows strong similarity with the far-field acoustic spectra.
 Probes 1, 3, and 5, shows the the first main tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

 although with less sharpness than the second tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $2655\,Hz$
\end_inset

.
 The second and third tones are prominent and a steady decay for the higher
 frequencies are noted.
 Due to absence of a developed boundary layer or incoming turbulence, this
 pressure field is the incident acoustic field recorded by the wall pressure
 sensors.
 The same behavior can also be noted for probes 14, 16, 19, and 20, moving
 progressively from the trailing edge to the cove region on the pressure
 side of the main element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For probes inside the slat cove, namely, Probe 6, 8, 10, and 11, the obtained
 spectra shows a progressive behavior.
 The spectra for Probe 6 which is close to the slat cusp shows the second
 tonal peak at 
\begin_inset Formula $2655\,Hz$
\end_inset

 as the dominant tone and the first tone at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

 is shadowed by the low frequency fluctuations arising from the behavior
 of cove motion.
 This drowning of the tonal oscillations increases progressively towards
 the slat cusp, and for Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $11$
\end_inset

, the tones are completely dominated by steady noise from the impinging
 vortex structures.
 The overall low frequency noise below 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,Hz$
\end_inset

 also increases obscuring the hump at this frequency corresponding to the
 first Rossiter mode.

From inspection of data of Probe 6 and its replicates, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, it can be noted that the spanwise modulations are reproduced in the low
 frequency part of the spectra particularly above 
\begin_inset Formula $200\,Hz$
\end_inset

 and below 
\begin_inset Formula $1000\,Hz$
\end_inset

.
 The spectra in this region tends to

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout
\end_inset
 for spanwise
 locations that correspond to pressure locations which are at the diverging
 plane of the spanwise velocity field.
 Probe 6 location being close to the slat cusp with spanwise modulation
 at low frequency verifies the hypothesis that spanwise nodal planes are
 stronger and driven by the initial curvature of the shear layer.
 It also further suggests that there are low frequency fluctuations particularly
 associated with such planes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For other probes, namely Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $7$
\end_inset

 which is adjacent to Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

, but deeper into the cove from the slat cusp, the spanwise modulation in
 the wall pressure spectra becomes less pronounced.
 This is expected from the shape of the spanwise velocity contours which
 shows that the cells near the slat cusp region is closer to the shear layer
 than the wall and also transition to the upper chain of cells as we move
 along the inner wall of the slat.
 The modulation again gather strength for Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $9$
\end_inset

, also with a lowering of the low frequency contents.
 As we move further towards the impingement location with Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $13$
\end_inset

, the low frequency contents again becomes dominant due to the possible
 contribution from low frequency fluctuations associated with strongly curved
 flow at the impingement location.

\end_inset

 can be seen to be present irrespective of the spanwise location.
 The first tonal peak at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

 however seems to be more susceptible to the spanwise modulations particularly
 for Probes 
\begin_inset Formula $8$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $9$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 For the low frequency hump at 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,Hz$
\end_inset

, the wall pressure spectra is not able to provide a clear identification,
 although for probes outside the cove, namely Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $19$
\end_inset

The initial reduction of the low frequency fluctuations from Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

, placed at the highly curved flow region near the cusp, to intermediate
 probes and then gaining strength towards the impingement location again
 with highly curved flow due to impingement suggest that these fluctuations
 could be the result of modes driven by the centrifugal instability.
 Another possible reason can be that the concave wall geometry acts as as
 a reflecting surface that leads to partial focusing of the reflected pressure
 waves near such locations.
 Furthermore, from Probe 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

 in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 oscillations around

 corresponding to the low frequency hump in the far-field acoustic spectra.

Now, from the presence of converging and diverging planes of spanwise velocity,
 it is possible that the fluid accumulates at the converging plane and has
 to be redistributed to the diverging planes by a dynamic mechanism.
 We hence how hypothesize that it is the periodic bursting of the early
 shear layer at the diverging planes that leads to this redistribution of
 fluid and in this process results in hydrodynamic pressure oscillation
 eventually leading the radiation of acoustic waves at this frequency.
 This mechanism therefore must be the most pronounced in the hot-wire measuremen
ts at the slat cusp if a spanwise investigation is enabled.

The hot-wire probe data allows to analyze single point time series recording
 of the flow velocity.
 The point recording captured from LBM simulation at selected nodes are

 Here they are used to study spanwise variability of the flow.

Various groups of probes are used to obtain the velocity fields near the
 cusp, near the slat trailing edge, and on few select locations on the main
 element wall.
 We intend to call these probe groups as files and their positions are shown
 in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 Among these we first analyze the file placed near the cusp across the early
 shear layer, capturing the variation of turbulent velocity field from outside
 of the cove flow to its interior.
 For this, first the mean velocity magnitude is plotted as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:averagehotwiseSLmag"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The time-averaged velocity magnitude profile shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:averagehotwiseSLmag"

\end_inset

 concurs with the mean inflow velocity of 
\begin_inset Formula $50 m/sm/s$
\end_inset

, and the deceleration due to presence of the main-element outside of the
 cove region.
 The mean recirculation velocity near the cusp is obtained as 
\begin_inset Formula $15 m/sm/s$
\end_inset

, which also concurs with Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:velocityacrossshearlayer"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The velocity magnitude profiles are also largely spanwise invariant outside
 the cove and have a deviation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm5 m/sm/s$
\end_inset

 inside the recirculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The profiles for all velocity components are also shown.
 For the spanwise component shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:averagehotwireSLZvel"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the region outside the cove region shows negligible variation whereas
 for the region inside the cove, the velocity switched signs with a peak
 amplitudes of 
\begin_inset Formula $7 m/sm/s$
\end_inset

, suggesting that the spanwise modulation is the main contributor to total
 velocity modulation along the span.
 The alternating averaged spanwise velocities correspond to the spanwise
 cells previously demonstrated in Fig.

 The periodic oscillations are interestingly absent in the locations of
 the converging planes where the fluid is removed from the spanwise motion
 potentially entrained by the shear layer.
 This suggest that redistribution mechanism arising from presence of nodal
 planes tend to develop a low frequency pulsating behavior with which the
 initial shear layer bursts periodically.
 This low frequency bursting is also consistent with the behavior identified

Such a periodic bursting if present may affect the acoustics.
 Since the Rossiter mechanism is driven by the impingement of spanwise coherent
 vortices at the slat trailing edge, the retained spanwise coherence is
 a necessary factor for exciting a strong resonance.
 The periodic disruption of the spanwise coherence of the early vortices
 thereby affects the resulting acoustic tones through an amplitude modulation.
 Furthermore, for Probe 20, which is placed deeper into the cove inside
 the shear layer, the spectral content shows increased activity at the same
 frequency of

 Here the averaged spanwise velocity modulation is also with a higher amplitude

The Rossiter mechanism is a dominantly 2D phenomena and a 3D aspect can

 Thus a variation of the oscillation amplitude of the hydrodynamic field

 affected.
 This is in line with the fact that the first mode has a lower power levels

 Moreover, the experimental studies assume that the flow in slat cove is
 dominantly 2D and examines wall pressure and hot wire probes at the spanwise
 center plane.
 This location in a symmetric setting can be reasonable assumed to have
 a diverging or converging plane for the spanwise velocity leading to concentrat
ion, rarification, and periodic behavior of the recirculated small scale
 streamwise structures.
 This will lead to erroneous evaluation of the turbulence and its spectral
 parameters.
 On the other hand, had the probes be placed in a plane corresponding to
 the center of a spanwise cell, the evaluated parameters would have been
 different for the first tonal peak.

 The effect is hence reasonably assumed to be the result of centrifugal

 fluid dynamic feature of the cove motion, which was not identified previously

 This generates planes of convergence and divergence of the fluid mass.
 The fluid mass hence must be redistributed from the converging planes to
 the diverging planes to maintain mass continuity in the spanwise flow.
 However, in the peculiar configuration of a cavity flow bounded by a shear
 layer on one side, the velocity of flow outside the shear layer which entrains
 the fluid from the recirculation is at a higher velocity than the inner
 recirculation which plays the role of redistributing the fluid back to
 the diverging planes.
 Due to this difference of flow rates, the entrainment and removal of fluid
 mass is faster at converging planes and redistribution is slower in diverging
 planes leading to an imbalance of the mass continuity.
 This imbalance saturates periodically leading to a local bursting of the
 shear layer at the location of diverging planes, enabling mass transfer
 across the shear layer and leading to generation of streamwise oriented
 vortices in the process.
 The bursting hence periodically and locally disrupts the spanwise homogeneity
 of early shear layer in terms of spanwise vorticity and hence the spanwise
 coherence of the 2D K-H vortices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One key ingredient in understanding the subsequent effects of such a cove
 bursting is in the fact that the bursting occurs at the diverging planes.
 Since the velocity is diverging, the generated streamwise vortices are
 convected either by the positive velocity or by the negative.
 By nature of turbulent flow, the bursting location is located more frequently
 at the center and hence the convection direction is selected in a stochastic
 manner.
 Consequently their location of impingement at the trailing edge of the
 slat also varies in the same fashion.
 This is precisely the phenomena noted in the recent work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wei2025a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 where spanwise location of the tonal sources shows intermittent variations
 along the spanwise locations at the slat trailing edge.
 Our demonstrations hence provides a plausible explanation on what fundamentally
 drives this dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the Rossiter mechanism selects the frequencies based on the number
 of vortices that are shed which upon impingement are able to close the
 aeroacoustic loop.
 This means that if there is a periodic disruption of spanwise coherence,
 select Rossiter peaks would be affected depending on the frequency of the
 modulating oscillation, while the vortex shedding at other frequency multiples
 can remain intact.
 One direct evidence of such a periodic disruption of spanwise coherence
 is that the acoustic waves formed by impinging vortices which drives the
 Rossiter mechanism will show an amplitude modulation in time.
 The amplitude modulation will then lead to non-linear transfer of energy
 between the tonal frequencies is also a popular phenomena is slat noise,
 though unexplained.
 Here the first broadband hump which corresponds to the first Rossiter tone
 is weaker in the sound level compared to the second tone, and is not evident
 in the VALIANT experiment against installation noise.
 This peak also shows intermittent behavior according to

 A further investigation of the farfield spectra observed by

, within a frequency range of approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta St_{s}=0.12$
\end_inset

 We here theorize that this appearance of shoulders for the broadband low
 frequency hump is the result of the first Rossiter mode (corresponding
 to the BB hump) being amplitude modulated.

Here, the Strouhal numbers for the Rossiter tones are dependent on the shear
 layer path length.
 Following the hypothesis that the low frequency oscillation is due to the
 effect of mass flow disparity, the Strouhal number for the low frequency
 oscillation is not necessarily linked to the shear layer path length but
 related to the difference of velocity, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta U=U_{0}-U_{i}$
\end_inset

, between the inner cove and the free stream and also to the length of spanwise
 cells 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, if the frequency of the cove bursting is 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B},$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B}\propto\Delta U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{B}\propto\frac{1}{\lambda_{s}}$
\end_inset

 , then 
\begin_inset Formula $St_{B}\propto\frac{\Delta U}{\lambda_{s}}\times\frac{C_{s}}{U_{\infty}}$
\end_inset

 However, the spanwise cell wavelength is proportional to the slat chord
 as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula $St_{B}$

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the velocity of recirculation.
 Hence Strouhal number for the bursting phenomena can be reasonably assumed
 to be dependent only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta U$
\end_inset

, the velocity difference across the initial shear layer.
 Nevertheless a more rigorous approach on extracting a model for this Strouhal
 number requires precise knowledge of the dependence of spanwise cell size
 based on the slat chord.

Furthermore, from the inspection of data recorded from the high fidelity
 simulation, the vortex visualization enables to identify the cove bursting.
 For this, we increase the Q-criterion value used to obtain the iso-contours
 to obtain a smooth cover of the region of initial shear layer such that
 a bursting of this spanwise coherent isocontour, itself arising from the
 spanwise vorticity of the early shear layer, can be identified.

 It can be noticed that the spanwise coherence of the shear layer is burst
 in a quick burst of streamwise vorticity formation which is then convected
 along the shear layer.
 The generated vortices also gain a spanwise velocity corresponding to the
 position of the bursting, i.e.
 the vortices from the bursting are carried by the positive of negative
 spanwise velocity depending on the proximity of such vortices to the negative
 or positive velocity cells in the initial stage.
 This suggests that the position of the bursting is only approximately static
 in the very early shear layer, and towards the impingement location the
 location of vortices from the bursting can be highly chaotic.
 This is only of significance if there is a sufficient difference of characteris
tic between the region of vortices from bursting and the slurry of streamwise
 vortices already present towards the impingement location.

 The slat positioning was kept as standard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of the study was to investigate the details of data generated
 using unsteady 3D LBM for the slat cove flow and to revisit existing knowledge
 on its noise mechanism.
 In line with this, the unsteady visualizations of the cove vortices using
 Q-criterion was obtained and the behavior of spanwise coherent structures
 and their conversion to small scale streamwise structures were discussed.
 The generation of streamwise structures were shown to be possibly influenced
 by the curvature instability of the shear layer which augments the current
 understanding of their behaviors.
 Detailed visualizations were used to suggest that the vortices are generated
 from the outer periphery of the spanwise coherent structures and that a
 major fraction of the recirculated vortices are entrained and consumed
 by the spanwise coherent vortices from the early the shear layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On inspecting the mean flow contours of the velocity and pressure fields
 in the cove, the 2D flow components largely agreed with the existing knowledge
 of slat cove dynamics.
 However, the distributions of spanwise velocity rendered strong spanwise
 modulations which called into question the veracity of a spanwise homogeneous
 flow typically assumed for the configuration in both experiments and numerical
 simulations.
 The spanwise velocity modulation with amplitude upto more than 
\begin_inset Formula $10%\ensuremath{\%}
$
\end_inset

 of the mean stream velocity was observed in the simulation which used a
 spanwise domain length of more than 
\begin_inset Formula $5C_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.66C,$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the slat chord length and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is the stowed chord of the full HLD.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To establish that the modulation is not an artifact of the simulation due
 to application of the periodic boundary condition, a simulation of the
 original wind tunnel geometry along with the lateral supporting plates
 were used.
 Here, the flow around the HLD was typically expected to be spanwise homogeneous
 in the region which is free from the influence of the wall in the experiment.
 But counter-intuitively this region was found to have a length of 0.2
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 However, the presence of spanwise modulations were also strongly disrupted
 by the presence of wall related turbulence for the rest of the span.
 Hence it is inferred that the presence of spanwise modulations is not a
 numerical artifact of the simulation but an effect of the centrifugal force
 due to the recirculating motion in the cove.
 To further the argument, two other simulations, one with a reduced span
 length by a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

 and another with a subsized geometry with the chord scaled by a factor
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{3}$
\end_inset

 are also presented.
 Both the cases are also shown to retain the spanwise cell formation with
 the latter having a higher spanwise wave number for the modulations demonstrati
ng that the feature responds to the geometrical conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On further investigation of the mean flow distributions, it was inferred
 that the spanwise modulation of velocity leads to generation of converging
 and diverging 2D planes.
 At these planes, if we move along the positive spanwise direction, spanwise
 velocity switches signs.
 For those which switches the velocity from negative to positive are what
 we refer to as the diverging planes and they act as a source of the fluid
 for spanwise flow.
 The vice-versa is true for the converging planes which act as the sinks
 enabling entrainment of flow into the flow exterior to the recirculation.
 Such a configuration was shown to distort the pressure field in the cove
 such that the low pressure center of recirculation (time-averaged) generated
 due the centrifugal effect is not spanwise homogeneous, but deflected towards
 the shear layer at the location of the diverging nodal planes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spanwise variation of the velocity spectra for the spanwise component
 then revealed that there exists an oscillation at 200Hz, corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $St\approx0.156$
\end_inset

.
 These periodic oscillations since occurring at the diverging planes only
 at the early share layer can potentially affect the spanwise coherence
 of the shed eddies.
 Moreover, the streamwise vortices generated in this oscillation are convected
 towards both spanwise directions from the diverging plane in a stochastic
 manner.
 The latter phenomena is thus suggested as a plausible reason for recently
 discovered stochastic nature of the spanwise coherence location, trailing
 edge turbulence characteristics, and the non-linear interaction between
 the slat tones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, based on the above inferences, we suggest in this chapter that the
 spanwise modulation of the spanwise velocity present in the slat cove have
 a non-trivial impact on both the cove vortex dynamics and their acoustic
 signature.
 The problem of spanwise mode generation itself is sparingly attended in
 the fluid dynamics literature although the same has been noted, intrigued
 on, and partially characterized in the works including that of

 A further investigation of these phenomena is an interesting topic of future
 research and can be undertaken by fundamental analysis of the behavior
 of the Navier-Stokes equation under the effect of strong curvature of of
 a shear layer which bounds a region of recirculation.
 For its implications for slat noise, it is clear from this demonstration
 that experimental investigations which use 2D PIV and hotwire measurements
 at the spanwise center-plane will not be able to capture the spanwise mode
 formations.
 This explains why the stochasticity of slat Rossiter tones remained elusive
 of a reasonable explanation, and the discrepancies related to the tone

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The design of computer simulation experiments is a fundamental aspect of
 scientific computing.
 Effective simulation campaigns necessitate a strategic plan to explore
 a parametric space of interest, enabling accurate inference of its behavior.
 Although the ideal outcome is a highly detailed representation of the parametri
c space, the escalating costs associated with each simulation constrain
 the number of experiments that can be conducted within a given computational
 budget.
 The primary objective of a Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology is therefore
 to implement a statistically optimal sampling technique, ensuring that
 each costly simulation maximizes its information yield
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Anderson2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 From an optimization perspective, the challenge is to develop an efficient
 routine that approximates the behavior of the parameter of interest with
 the fewest possible query points.
 This solution varies depending on the nature of the problem, its dimensionality
, data acquisition costs, and other factors
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Koziel2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Consequently, it is imperative to devise an optimal method for sampling
 the parameter space, such as in the context of this study, where data on
 the far-field acoustic signature of a slat-airfoil configuration, focusing
 on the position of the leading-edge slat relative to the airfoil, is needed.
 Each data point acquisition involves an LBM-FWH simulation, as detailed
 in the previous chapter, a procedure known for its computational expense
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Shao2019"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first approach to DOE is to discretize the parameter space and query discrete
 points uniformly from the resulting manifold.
 However, the number of points grows exponentially with the number of dimensions
 and is hence sample inefficient.
 The use of factorial designs, which instead of querying all the discrete
 points, systematically explores all possible combinations of discrete parameter
 levels, obtaining a sparser representation of the manifold, reduces compute
 costs but is not optimal because the acquisition is still not carried out
 based on information availability.
 Strategies derived from these factorial designs, such as fractional factorial
 designs, Latin hypercube sampling, and adaptive sampling methods, aim to
 balance the trade-off between discretization size of the manifold and efficienc
y of acquisition.
 These methods are therefore theoretically optimal to sample a manifold
 apriori to the experiment and guarantee that the cost of simulation is
 the least possible against the information collected on the parameter manifold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Surrogate Modeling(SMs) is a more recent approach to cost-effective technique
 to aid in the inference of the parameter space involving expensive simulations
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Alizadeh2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 A surrogate model or a response surface is an approximate discrete representati
on of the behavior of a simulated variable of the given parameter domain
 which can be used to infer the behavior of the variable over the continuous
 parameter space.
 In simple Response Surface Modelling (RSM)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Khuri2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the response surface is assumed to be a linear function of the parameters
 whose coefficients are then deduced from a few available data points, i.e.
 a linear fit which demands only 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{D}$
\end_inset

 number of observations, same as the dimensionality of the problem.
 When it is known that the response is non-linear, an approximate polynomial
 order can be assumed and the corresponding coefficients can be computed.
 This method hence results in a fixed number of points per parameter if
 an approximate function can be guessed correctly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In more recent advances, the data collected over a response surface in the
 first few simulations can be subjected to a more rigorous statistical data
 analysis and better inferences about the surface can be obtained.
 Such methods includes that of Kriging
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gano2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and Active Learning methods
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kottke2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and primarily involves deploying the Bayes' theorem to statistically estimate
 the nature of the response surface.
 The estimated probabilities are then used to guide the acquisition process
 which leads to sample efficiency.
 Theoretically, the data acquisition can be controlled online, i.e.
 the decision to make new query points are not determined apriori to the
 experiment but are adaptively calculated during the acquisition process.
 The nature of this active acquisition leads to different methods of surrogate
 modelling.
 For the purpose of this work, we adapt and deploy the Gaussian Process
 Surrogate model for creating a response surface of the noise characteristics
 of the HLD under study.
 The noise surrogate is then utilized to design an experiment based on the
 active learning strategy to acquire data and provide a fast-turn around
 model for noise behavior based on the slat positioning.
 In the rest of this chapter, we explain the details on the construction
 of this model.

\begin_layout Section
Bayes' Theorem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental idea in the statistical school of thought
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and provides a simple rule to calculate conditional probabilities.
 According to the Bayes's rule, commonly written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align right
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(H\mid E)P(E)=P(E\mid H)P(H)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(H\mid E)$
\end_inset

 is the conditional probability of a hypothesis 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 being true in the light of some observed evidence 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 being available, and 
\begin_inset Formula $P(E)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P(H)$
\end_inset

 are the raw probabilities of the evidence to exist and the hypothesis to
 be true.
\begin_inset Note Comment

, the probability of a hypothesis being true after the fact that some of
 the evidence 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 suggesting so can be calculated mathematically using this simple formula.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In effect, the Bayes' rule leads us to think that for any scenario determined
 by the rules of probabilities, we can first form a prior belief about a
 hypothesis, and then numerically update the probability of that hypothesis
 being true according to our observation of evidences.
 Indeed, the prior hypothesis can be even a false one with respect to reality
 but can still be updated in the wake of new observations and be updated
 iteratively to obtain a true representation of the reality.
 The formula itself is a representation of how this updation of the belief
 must be done numerically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayes' formula can be reasoned to arise from a symmetry of the probabilities
, i.e.
 in the symmetry of argument between the probability of a hypothesis being
 true 'if' the evidence is present and and probability of observing evidence
 'if' the hypothesis was true.
 The left side of the equation gives a product of the probability of a hypothese
s H being true in the presence of observed evidence E, and the probability
 of observation of such an evidence E.
 Together they represent the probability of the hypothesis being true 'if'
 the evidences are observed.
 On the right hand, we have the product of the probability of the evidence
 being observed given that the hypothesis was true (

), and together it represent the probability of the observation of the evidence

 'if' the hypothesis is true.
 This symmetry leads to the objective equality of these two quantities and
 hence the formula.

Bayes' formula becomes a powerful tool once written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula

where,

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 The conditional probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(E\mid H)$
\end_inset

 is called the likelihood, being the probability of the observation of evidence
 given that 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

 is true.
 Emphasis must be given to the fact that the formula is useful for both
 an iterative procedure to updating the prior to converge towards a conclusion
 of reality or, when a sufficient sample of the data is available already,
 allows direct estimation of the real nature of the hypothesis.
 In a Bayesian inference setting, if we are trying to estimate the true
 value of a variable, the Bayesian posterior will converge to the exact
 value if an infinite number of samples are collected.
 For a rigorous explanation of this fact, refer to Section 5.3 in the work
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This asymptotic behavior is however not true at every intermediate step
 of a Bayesian inference procedure and that difference is the core feature
 which differentiates a Bayesian paradigm to statistical inference from
 that of the Frequentist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a Frequentist approach to probability, the objective value of a probability
 is obtained by repeating an experiment infinite number of times.
 This means that the value of the probability is an intrinsic quantity related
 to the experiment and each run of the experiment is a realization of the
 process that functions according to the set probability.
 On the other hand, in the Bayesian perspective, the probability of an event
 is only a measure of the confidence that the event will occur and is not
 inherently derived from an infinite sampling.
 In other words, in Bayesian perspective, probability has a meaning while
 using a finite sample size as the representation of the confidence in a
 prediction for the next sample.
 This is while Frequentist approach cannot give a prediction of confidence
 in the prediction for the exact next sample, based on only the previous
 experiments.
 In fact, if the sample size is large enough, the Bayesian estimate and
 the Frequentist probability will converge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that the Bayes's formula is familiarized, let us visit the premise of
 how to use Bayesian inference for a regression and surrogate modelling
 problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Gaussian Processes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gaussian Processes (GPs) also known as Kriging or Wiener-Kolmogorov
 prediction, are a popular and powerful tool in the repertoire of statistical
 inference and regression
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rasmussen2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It is a non-parametric tool for modelling complex functions that are otherwise
 not amenable to analytical modelling.
 The key advantage of GPs is that they can be used to approximate a function
 or response surface while the nature of the function is not explicitly
 known.
 Moreover, the function modelled is a distribution over functions meaning
 that the GP representation of a function is an average function along with
 a standard deviation function.
 This naturally leads to uncertainty quantification on the approximation
 and also enables the use of Bayesian methods for estimation of the variables.
 The latter property is what makes GPs well suited as a function approximator
 in the Bayesian regression setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More precisely, a Gaussian process is a function approximator of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in\{y_{1},y_{2},y_{3},...,y_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 in a multidimensional domain of 
\begin_inset Formula $X\in\{x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},...,x_{n}\}$
\end_inset

.
 As it is possible to assume that the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 are not numerical values but a random variable.
 If we assume that these variables have a Gaussian distribution each, then
 the collection of these variables into 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 leads it to have a jointly Gaussian distribution.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 can then be written using the joint distribution as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y\approx\mathcal{N}(\mu(X),K(X,X))
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $μ(X)$
\end_inset

 is the mean function, often taken to be zero as an initial guess, and 
\begin_inset Formula $K(X,X)$
\end_inset

 is the covariance matrix.
 The mean function now is an average function over the domain whereas the
 covariance matrix determines the flexibility or expressiveness of this
 function.
 This is because, for each realization sampled for 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, we obtain a function that has different values at each of the discrete
 points 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}...,y_{n}$
\end_inset

 but their mean values are determined by corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{1},\mu_{2},\mu_{3}...,\mu_{n},$
\end_inset

and then their variances by the deviatoric components of 
\begin_inset Formula $K(X,X)$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}...,y_{n}$
\end_inset

 are not completely independent, but are rather correlated, the correlation
 between each component denoted by corresponding elements of the 2D symmetric
 covariance matrix

The nature of this correlation matrix can now be understood more deeply
 if we assume simple forms.
 Let us say that the correlation matrix is a banded matrix with the major
 diagonal as unity and adjacent elements slightly less.
 In this case, each of the elements will be correlated to its immediate
 neighbor on both sides and to none other.
 Thus for each realization, the sampled values of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 will be smoothed due to the constraint of adjacent elements by the correlation.
 If the bandwidth of the correlation matrix is increased, each element will
 then be correlated with more and more of its neighbors thus leading to
 stiffness of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 towards a homogeneous one.
 Thus the bandwidth of the correlation matrix directly leads to the expressivene
ss of the Gaussian processes.

thus primarily represents the nature of the approximator given by a Gaussian
 process.
 In a detailed analysis, the covariance matrix is often subjected to the
 Mercer's theorem which guarantees that for a positive definite symmetric
 matrix such as a covariance matrix, an eigen decomposition is always possible
 into an infinite space of eigenvalue-eigenfunction pairs
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Steinwart2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the GP context, these eigen functions are then a set of infinite number
 of feature functions representing the feature space on which the GP attempts
 to represent a given test function.
 In a regression or classification problem, the projection of input datapoints
 and query points onto this infinite dimensional feature space is possible
 without the exact knowledge of the feature space itself and without explicit
 calculation of their infinite dimensional coordinates.
 This saves the computation of data transformations to latent spaces and
 provides straightforward computation of predictive distributions and is
 essentially called the 'kernel trick'.

In order to use Gaussian Processes for Bayesian regression and to generate
 a noise-surrogate of the high-lift device, we follow the theoretical framework
 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Accordingly, a linear regression problem imbibes the properties of a stochastic
 process by assumption of an additive noise to the data representing its
 aleatoric uncertainty.
 It then follows that a linear regressor for a given dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}=\{(\boldsymbol{x_{i}},y_{i})\thinspace|\thinspace i=1,...,n\}$
\end_inset

 mapping multidimensional observations from domain 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 to the scalar targets 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

can be written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y=f(\mathbf{x})+\varepsilon=\mathbf{x}^{\top}\mathbf{w}+\varepsilon\label{eq:gpeqn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{\varepsilon\sim N}\left(0,\sigma_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a normally distributed statistical noise with mean 0 and standard deviation
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, the linear fitting weights also need to be expressed as a
 distribution that is assumed to be a Gaussian distribution as well for
 the ensuing mathematical necessity.
 The target variable also now is obtained as a statistical process, y =
 {
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{2},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{3}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

, ...}.
 It can be noted that if a Gaussian noise is assumed together with the assumptio
n that linear weights are also Gaussian distributed, then calculating the
 joint probability of the process 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 in the presence of the feature data 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and the chosen weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is written as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{y}\mid X,\mathbf{w})$
\end_inset

 and its joint probability (conditional) is calculated as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}p(\mathbf{y}\mid X,\mathbf{w}) & =\prod_{i=1}^{n}p\left(y_{i}\mid\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{w}\right)\\
 & =\prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_{n}}\exp\left(-\frac{\left(y_{i}-\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\top}\mathbf{w}\right)^{2}}{2\sigma_{n}^{2}}\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\sigma_{n}^{2}\right)^{n/2}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma_{n}^{2}}\left(\mathbf{y}-X^{\top}\mathbf{w}\right)^{\top}\left(\mathbf{y}-X^{\top}\mathbf{w}\right)\right)\\
 & =\mathcal{N}\left(X^{\top}\mathbf{w},\sigma_{n}^{2}I\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, the likelihood distribution, as 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{y}\mid X,\mathbf{w})$
\end_inset

 is named, also inherits the Gaussianity with a mean distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\top}\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 and the covariance being 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}^{2}I_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the posterior is now essentially a Gaussian process whose mean function
 follows the classical linear fit on the data and with a covariance matrix
 directly following the assumed noise in the data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, in a regression task, the goal is to obtain a set of weights for a
 suitable set of basis functions such that the data can be modelled, and
 used for predictions of unsampled data points.
 To enable this, we need to deduce the distribution functions that represent
 the weights.
 This is achieved by deploying the Bayes' theorem over the above linear
 regression problem, i.e.
 according to Bayes' formula, the conditional probabilities can be inverted
 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{w}\mid\mathbf{y},X)p(\mathbf{y}\mid X)=p(\mathbf{y}\mid X,\mathbf{w})p(\mathbf{w})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{y}\mid X,\mathbf{w})$
\end_inset

 is the likelihood, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{w})$
\end_inset

 is the assumed prior belief on the distribution of weights or simply the
 prior, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{w}\mid\mathbf{y},X)$
\end_inset

 is the conditional posterior distribution on the weights, conditioned on
 the available sample points 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbf{y},X)$
\end_inset

.
 The second term on the left hand side is 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{y}\mid X)$
\end_inset

 is called the marginal likelihood, being dependent only on the available
 data, and can be expressed as an integral over the weight distribution
 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{y}\mid X)=\int p(\mathbf{y}\mid X,\mathbf{w})p(\mathbf{w})d\mathbf{w}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this perspective, the marginal likelihood is the likelihood of the dataset
 integrated over the space of all possible weight distributions and serves
 as a normalization factor.
 To enable the calculation of the posterior, it is also now necessary to
 define the prior distribution of the weights.
 Assuming Gaussianity such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{0},\Sigma_{p}\right)$
\end_inset

, the posterior distribution of weights 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\mathbf{w}\mid\mathbf{y},X)$
\end_inset

 given a set of observations from the dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

, follows 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}p(\mathbf{w}\mid X,\mathbf{y}) & \propto p(\mathbf{y}\mid X,\mathbf{w})p(\mathbf{w})\\
 & \propto\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma_{n}^{2}}\left(\mathbf{y}-X^{\top}\mathbf{w}\right)^{\top}\left(\mathbf{y}-X^{\top}\mathbf{w}\right)\right)\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{w}^{\top}\Sigma_{p}^{-1}\mathbf{w}\right)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p(\mathbf{w}\mid X,\mathbf{y}) & \propto\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{w}-\overline{\mathbf{w}})^{\top}\left(\frac{1}{\sigma_{n}^{2}}XX^{\top}+\Sigma_{p}^{-1}\right)(\mathbf{w}-\overline{\mathbf{w}})\right)\\

\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\mathbf{w}}=\sigma_{n}^{-2}A^{-1}X\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\sigma_{n}^{-2}XX^{\top}+\Sigma_{p}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The posterior also thus inherits the Gaussianity assumed on the prior probabili
ty on the weights and the additive statistical noise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that a posterior distribution of the weights conditioned by the available
 data can be computed, a regression based on the Gaussian process representation
 of the target variable is possible.
 For this, the only assumption to be made is the prior probability distribution,
 or precisely its correlation matrix.
 However, in the Bayesian perspective, the prior distribution only represents
 the initial belief about a hypothesis, and given that Bayesian posterior
 enables the conditioning the prior on the available data, the initial assumptio
n on the prior does not affect the calculation significantly.
 Or in other words, within the Bayes' formula, the prior and the likelihood
 terms compete with each other to influence the posterior distribution,
 and by the effect of this conditioning, the posterior develops adherence
 to the available data.
 In the event that sufficient data is available to obtain a well fitted
 model by using the underlying basis function, the significance of the prior
 reduces and the posterior converges to the true distribution that can be
 inferred from the available data as the dataset grows.
 This convergence with only weak assumptions of the prior distribution of
 weights is what in essence makes the Bayesian regression using Gaussian
 process a powerful regression tool.

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

 Such an averaging can be written as the integral
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the final predictive distribution is obtained analytically with
 the help of the assumption of Gaussianity on all the variables involved.
 The terms involved are the covariance of the assumed statistical noise,
 covariance of the prior distribution, and the dataset only and thus simplifies
 the actual calculation as opposed to the rather esoteric definition of
 a Gaussian process regressor itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being the case, the linear regression using this Bayesian technique
 can be easily translated to a non-linear regression using arbitrary basis.
 For this the linear approximation function can be replaced as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
i.e.
 by replacing the raw feature space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, its transformation using an arbitrary non-linear basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 .
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is a projection of the input vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 onto the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 itself is a collection of the unit column vectors or arbitrary dimensions
 of the feature space.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})^{\top}\Sigma_{p}\phi(\mathbf{x}')$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(\mathbf{x}_{*}\right)^{\top}\Sigma_{p}\phi\left(\mathbf{x}_{*}\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $k=\phi^{\top}\Sigma_{p}\phi$

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such a formulation leads us to the previously mentioned 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kernel trick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It can be observed that in this form of the predictive distribution, the
 arbitrary basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 always appears as part of an inner product of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})^{\top}\Sigma_{p}\phi(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 be it for query points as 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x}_{*})$
\end_inset

 or datapoints as 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 However, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{\top}\Sigma_{p}\phi$
\end_inset

 is a quadratic form, an inner product on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{p}$
\end_inset

 which is a positive definite, regardless of the assumptions on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, a square root 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{p}^{1/2}$
\end_inset

 is always defined and 
\begin_inset Formula $K(x,x')=\phi^{\top}(\mathrm{x})\Sigma_{p}\phi(\mathrm{x})$
\end_inset

 can be represented purely as an inner product 
\begin_inset Formula $K(x,x')=\psi(\mathrm{x})\cdot\psi\left(\mathrm{x}^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus to project the inputs to the feature space, it is indeed not necessary
 to transform the raw inputs to a high-dimensional input space, but instead
 the formulation can be used with only the kernel function in every instance
 of the inner product.
 In plain simple terms, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{\top}(\mathrm{x})$
\end_inset

 is a matrix product of the collection of high dimensional basis vectors
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and the input vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the kernel being representable as an inner product means that when
 
\begin_inset Formula $K(x,x')=\phi^{\top}(\mathrm{x})\Sigma_{p}\phi(\mathrm{x}')$
\end_inset

, it can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $K(x,x')=x^{\top}\phi\Sigma_{p}\phi\mathrm{x}'$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\Sigma_{p}\phi$
\end_inset

 remain an inner kernel regardless of the inputs.
 Now, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 always occurs only in the form of the inner product, then we does not need
 to know the actual form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 but only of the finite dimensional inner product 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\Sigma_{p}\phi$
\end_inset

 .
 This means that one can have a theoretically infinite dimensional feature
 space of arbitrary functionality, but in calculation use only a simpler
 representation of the inner product 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\Sigma_{p}\phi$
\end_inset

.

\color black
The predictive covariance according from Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:predictiveformula"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 has an intuitive explanation as well.
 The first term 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\left(\mathbf{x}_{*}\right)^{\top}\Sigma_{p}\phi\left(\mathbf{x}_{*}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a quadratic form representing the variance arising from position of
 query point with respect to the existing prior probability distribution
 and is always non-zero.
 This hence represent the maximum possible uncertainity according to the
 prior at the query point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{*}$
\end_inset

 before any observation is available at this point and is fully dependent
 on the prior or in the same sense the kernel choice.
 The second term on the other hand represent the reduction in uncertainity
 due to the observed data from the available dataset in the vicinity of
 the query point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 If no noise is assumed in the data, which corresponds to the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}=0$
\end_inset

, the full term reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula $K(\mathbf{x}_{*},X)K(X,X)^{-1}K(X,\mathbf{x}_{*})$
\end_inset

 which is non-zero only at a point which is not present in the dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 In the case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{*}\in X$
\end_inset

, then the term simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula $K(\mathbf{x}_{*},\mathbf{x}_{*})$
\end_inset

 by property of the matrix multiplication thereby collapsing the predictive
 variance.
 This is hence the iconic behavior of the GP regression that in the absence
 of assumed noise in the dataset, the GP regressor captures the training
 points exactly and with a zero variance.
 However, for points which are not in the dataset, the variance is inevitably
 non-zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It must also be noted that by choosing a kernel function, we are also choosing
 the prior distribution in the Gaussian processes since the kernel also
 has the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the only actual choice to be made in the formulation of a problem
 for deploying this algorithm are the kernel parameters.
 Hence, finally obtaining the predictive distribution using the Gaussian
 Process regression is by a straightforward calculation written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{l}
\mathbf{y}\\
\mathbf{f}_{*}
\end{array}\right]\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{0},\left[\begin{array}{cc}
K(X,X)+\sigma_{n}^{2}I & K\left(X,X_{*}\right)\\
K\left(X_{*},X\right) & K\left(X_{*},X_{*}\right)
\end{array}\right]\right)\label{eq:predictivedist}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kernel trick then involves only the selection of a suitable kernel
 which has a suitable family of basis functions.
 For an arbitrary positive semi-definite matrix, the underlying basis can
 be numerically obtained by calculating its eigen decomposition, where the
 matrix is decomposed as 
\begin_inset Formula $M=U\Sigma U^{\top}$
\end_inset

.
 For an analytic example, if we choose squared exponential function as a
 kernel, this kernel can be written as an infinite sum of Gaussian functions
 since
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}k\left(x_{p},x_{q}\right) & =\sigma_{p}^{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left(-\frac{\left(x_{p}-c\right)^{2}}{2\ell^{2}}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{\left(x_{q}-c\right)^{2}}{2\ell^{2}}\right)dc\\
 & =\sqrt{\pi}\ell\sigma_{p}^{2}\exp\left(-\frac{\left(x_{p}-x_{q}\right)^{2}}{2(\sqrt{2}\ell)^{2}}\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One particular kernel that is popular among the Machine Learning community
 is the Matern kernel.
 This takes the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{\text{Matern }}(r)=\frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2\nu}r}{\ell}\right)^{\nu}K_{\nu}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2\nu}r}{\ell}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 are tuning parameters and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is a modified Bessel function.
 For the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, the properties of the resulting kernel are usually matched for the requirement
 of the problem.
 If we set the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, the resulting function reduces to a simple exponential kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $k(r)=\exp(-r/\ell)$
\end_inset

.
 This kernel in 1D is the covariance function of the Ornstein-Ulhenbeck
 process that models the Brownian motion.
 The kernel thus gives a function that is excessively random for a smooth
 regression.
 A smoother version of the kernel is possible by choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\frac{3}{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{5}{2}$
\end_inset

, commonly called Matern32 and Matern52, and allows for modelling functions
 for practical applications.
 A value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu>\frac{7}{2}$
\end_inset

 also is not generally chosen since the resulting function tends to be excessive
ly noisy and is difficult to distinguish from slightly noisy input data

\begin_layout Standard
This section aims to develop a noise surrogate model for farfield spectra
 of high lift device where the position of the slat relative to the main
 element is the varying parameter.
 The input domain is hence composed of the slat position coordinates relative
 to the main element, namely, Slat Gap, Slat Deflection Angle, Slat Overlap,
 and Angle of Attack.
 A 4-dimensional input domain is finely suited for the Gaussian Process
 Regression model, given the fact that GP methods are cost prohibitive at
 higher dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $D>10$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, the target space is the far-field noise spectra and a spectrum
 as such is not amenable to modelling by Gaussian processes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frequency range of interest for slat noise was determined to be 20 kHzkHz.
 For a spectrum collected experimentally, the frequency resolution is typically
 1Hz and hence results in number of bins being 20,000.
 For a spectrum sampled from CFD, a resolution of 40Hz is typical, and will
 result in 500 frequency bins.
 This is still cost prohibitive in terms of modelling using GP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a solution, the spectrum needs to be converted to an alternative low
 order representation.
 One approach to this problem is to use a spline fit and to use the parameters
 of the spline functions as the predicted variable.
 However, this removes the physics informed modelling approach that is already
 available from the slat noise literature.
 A robust model of the slat noise was already developed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 based on the surface FWH equations on the radiating surface of the slat
 and is explained in Chapter 02.
 This is not reiterated here and instead we here design a reduced order
 approach for the representation of the power spectral density data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned, Guo's model gives the representation of the spectra in terms
 of multiple components as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{G}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{F}$
\end_inset

 are scaling factors depending on the flow geometry and flow parameters,
 
\begin_inset Formula $W(M)$
\end_inset

 is a weighting function dependent on the Mach number, 
\begin_inset Formula $F(f,M)$
\end_inset

 is the shape function, and 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\theta,\phi)$
\end_inset

 is the directionality function.
 This formula hence only contains terms which are derived from the physics
 of the problem and has no calibration parameters, and recovers the spectra
 satisfactorily for a good range of flow parameters and observer positions.
 However, for the purpose of extracting only the essential features of the
 PSD to aid simplification, we reduce the formula to the form 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Pi=a\times F(f,M)D(\theta,\phi)\label{eq:shapefunctionfeature}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, only the shape function and the directionality functions are retained
 and other factors are replaced with a single calibration parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

 The shape function as function of Strouhal number has the definition 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F(St,M)=\frac{M^{2}L_{S}}{c_{0}}\frac{St^{2}}{\left(1+\mu_{0}^{2}St^{2}\right)\left(1+\mu_{1}^{2}(1+M)^{2}St^{2}\right)\left(1+\mu_{2}^{2}M^{2}St^{2}\right)\left(1+\mu_{3}MSt\right)}

Here, the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0},$

\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{1},$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{2},$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{3}$
\end_inset

, are adjustable parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the flow Mach number, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{s}$
\end_inset

 is the characteristic length, taken to be the slat chord length, and 
\begin_inset Formula $St$
\end_inset

 is the Strouhal number.
 This function captures the shape of the characteristic broadband hump of
 the slat at a given Mach number.
 Since in our experiment, the inlet velocity is kept constant, the flow
 Mach number is not a variable.
 Hence this function adds additional four calibration coefficients to fit
 the spectra.
 For the case of directivity function, we retain the function as suggested
 originally by Guo for the initial development and hence it does not contribute
 new parameters.
 Finally, the total parameters from Guo's functions are 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\{a,\mu_{0},\mu_{1},\mu_{2},\mu_{3}\}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The second dominant feature of a slat noise spectra are the spectral peaks.
 These peaks are strongly suspected to be due to aeroacoustic resonance
 mechanism, but however the spacing between the peaks are not exactly homogeneou
s.
 Both peak frequencies and peak width at different frequencies are shown
 to have variations when the flow configurations change.
 Hence we choose to model them separately.
 For capturing the shape of the peak, we use the Lorentz pulse function
 form 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L=\frac{h_{n}}{1+\left(\frac{\text{St}-\text{St}_{n}}{\text{w}_{n}/2}\right)^{2}}

\begin_layout Standard
for which the three parameters are the pulse height 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{n}$
\end_inset

, the pulse width 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}$
\end_inset

, and the central frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{St}_{n}.$
\end_inset

 The slat noise spectra typically contain five dominant peaks over the broadband
 range and the number vary with the positioning of the slat.
 We choose to keep the number of peaks modeled to six.
 Three parameters for each peak then leads to a total of 12 parameters for
 the peaks.
 Hence in total, the total number of parameters to represent the spectra
 becomes 17.
 This target dimensionality is suitable for a low dimensional Gaussian process
 regression task.

Initial dataset

\begin_layout Standard
To generate a Gaussian Process regression model and to enable active-learning
 as a sampling technique, an initial dataset is required over which a naive
 surrogate model has to operate.
 For this we choose to generate our first set of simulations using the Latin
 Hypercube sampling.
 A Latin Hypercube is an efficient method to sample points from a multi-dimensio
nal space with the guarantee that all discrete intervals of the domain are
 sampled at least once.
 This type of sampling guarantees that the whole of the domain is covered
 in a fairly uniform manner obtaining a reasonable representation of the
 response surface, however much more sparsely than an interpretable form.
 Here although the canonical Latin Hypercube Sampling is widely used, the
 sampling algorithm can generate samples which are not most uniformly distribute
d in the multi-dimensional space.

 suggests a modified version of the LHS algorithm to have an improved uniformity
 of distribution of points in multidimensional space.
 They achieve the improvement by sequential elimination of samples that
 obtain the smallest average distance from other sampled points while generating
 the samples for each dimensions.
 The rest of the procedure remains the same as in the canonical method.

It must be mentioned that in our iterations to generate the initial dataset
 and while facilitating the analysis of the dynamics of the cove flow, it
 was found that cases with positive slat overlap are particularly silent
 in view of characteristic slat noise.
 This is due to the fact that in such cases the slat is positioned too close
 to the leading edge of the airfoil and the resulting mean shear layer is
 deformed is such a way that the aeroacoustic resonance mechanism is not
 favored.
 Hence for the presentation of this surrogate model we chose to omit the
 domain with positive slat overlap.
 The complete range of parameters used to initialize the dataset is shown
 in Table.

 As mentioned in the previous section, a Bayesian regression model generates
 a predictive distribution for the target variables of interest.
 Since these distributions are essentially a Gaussian probability distribution,
 the mean and variance of the variable can be computed over a range of values.
 The surface generated by the mean values of the predicted variable is output
 as the mean response surface.
 The variance is then used to estimate the confidence of the model for the
 prediction of the mean value.
 The confidence interval is a range of values for which there is a prescribed
 probability, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, for the value of the prediction to fall within and can is expressed by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 sample.
 Accordingly, for a Gaussian distribution, 5% confidence interval is the
 region where the value of the variable falls with 95% probability and the
 corresponding z-score is

The goal of the regression process is to reduce the epistemic uncertainty
 of the model arising from the noise in the data.
 But the noise that is added to the linear regressor for formulating the
 Gaussian Process Regression, as in Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, is in fact the aleatoric uncertainty assumption, i.e.
 the uncertainty assumed inherent in the training data due to measurement
 errors and inherent noise which are not reducible.
 The other type of uncertainty, which is the epistemic uncertainty, arises
 from modelling errors due to unoptimal parameters to fit the data, and
 due to insufficient data points.
 This uncertainty can be minimized by obtaining a better fit to the data
 through optimizing the model parameters.
 In the GP based Bayesian regression, the only model parameter to tune is
 the type of kernel and its correlation length scale.
 Optimising these parameters are the process of offline 'learning' in a
 GP regression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The uncertainty for the model arising from lack of datapoints can only be
 reduced by addition of new datapoints.
 However, since the predicted distribution is heteroscedastic, the sampling
 can be adapted to ensure an uncertainty informed sampling.
 For each new datapoint collected or batches of datapoints, the parameters
 of the model can be optimized to obtain a new model with reduced epistemic
 uncertainty.
 The new model uncertainties can then be used to obtain a suggestion for
 sampling the next datapoint or batch of points, thereby obtaining better
 sampling techniques that progressively minimizes the epistemic uncertainty.
 This approach to reducing the model uncertainty is called the active learning
 approach and is attempted in our work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the calculation using the first 10 data points, we use the Squared Exponenti
al kernel.
 A noise of 5% is assumed to enable the uncertainty calculation.
 This noise value is obtained by first enabling an iterative search for
 optimal noise value so as to obtain the best fit of the model output using
 least-square fitting of the predicted and available data.
 Then the noise value is kept fixed and the resulting predictive uncertainty
 is then used for the active learning.
 The hyperparameters of the model are the kernel parameters, namely the
 inverse of correlation length 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{l},$
\end_inset

 using which the kernel can be written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

The search bounds for this parameter is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{l}\in[0.05,20]$

 The parameter is then optimized using the gradient free optimizer COBYLA
 (Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximation) available with the SMT
 toolbox using default parameters.

 of the slat noise spectra to enable the regression.
 This means that predicted mean and uncertainties are in terms of the calibratio

 These uncertainties then need to be propagated through the model equations
 in order to obtain the uncertainty of the spectra calculation and allow
 a quantitative understanding of the model's confidence in the predictions.

Sampling the next simulation based on the current dataset is enabled in
 Bayesian optimization by combining the two above said techniques, i.e.
 by using the surrogate model and its uncertainty estimate.
 The straightforward approach for uncertainty based sampling is to look
 at points where the uncertainty is highest and sample a new point from
 this vicinity.
 Such a criteria looks only at the current state of the model and the effect
 of sampling on the immediate next state after the sampling.
 However this approach has shown to be sub-optimal when it comes to obtaining
 the best sample.
 To obtain a better estimate of the most efficient sample, a sample estimator
 is typically used in Bayesian optimization and is called the Acquisition
 function.
 
\end_layout

Many acquisition functions have been proposed in the literature, with one
 of the early ones being the Probability of Improvement (PI).
 This method is based on an estimate of the aforementioned acquisition function

 minima.

 Here the two terms arising from this definition contribute to two different
 factors that control an exploratory process.
 One is the contribution from the mean function which biases the estimated
 sample to minimize the mean function leading to finding the optima.
 The other terms proportional to the variance will bias the function towards
 areas where the function has large predictive variances, leading the optimizer
 to explore the domain potentially away from optimas.
 Thus there is a competition between the exploration and exploitation of
 the domain.
 Essentially, all acquisition functions fundamentally address this tradeoff
 and attempts to minimize the overall uncertainty in the least number of
 sampling operations.
 In this regard, the Expected Improvement (EI) is considered the standard
 procedure in application to finding the optima using Bayesian Optimization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further improvement of the acquisition function came from the work of
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Their suggestion was to use an acquisition function that minimize the uncertain
ty present in the location of the already computed optimal value.
 The method thus called the Entropy Search attempts to minimize the information
 entropy of the predictive distribution, but however due to the excessively
 complicated formalism, a closed form of the function is not derivable analytica
lly and for applications, an approximate form is used for the computations.

\begin_layout Standard
An acquisition function applicable to the case of surrogate modelling with
 a straight forward explicit calibration of the exploitation-exploration
 trade off is the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) proposed in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This function uses a simple algebraic form to obtain a utility function
 defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{\text{UCB}}(x;\beta)=\mu(x)+\beta\sigma(x)\label{eq:ucb}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two terms are the mean function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(x)$
\end_inset

 and the scaled standard deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 and the scaling factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 serves as a control between biasing the functions towards the maxima (exploitat
ion) or to uncertain regions of the domain (exploration).
 For using the UCB algorithm, two approaches can be followed.
 One is that the extremum of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\text{UCB}}$
\end_inset

 can be used to pick a sample for next data acquisition step and only 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 needs to be adjusted in order to calibrate the acquisition process.
 The other is to use 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\text{UCB}}$
\end_inset

 as a probability density function and sample from the distribution.
 The second variant leads to the stochastic UCB algorithm and allows to
 maintain a distributed random sampling over the domain.
 Compared to the non-stochastic version, this allows to ensure that the
 algorithm does not tend to conservatively follow the acquisition function
 itself but also allows a reasonable calibrated exploration of the domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purpose of our work, we choose to use an adapted version of the
 stochastic UCB algorithm.
 For this, we use the utility function in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ucb"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and use an additional thresholded distribution with 99% percent of the
 maximum as the threshold.
 The additional thresholding was found to be aiding in amplifying the PDF
 generated by the raw utility function 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\text{UCB}}$
\end_inset

 and hence enabled a more conservative sampling in terms of sampling efficiency.
 Consequently we chose to sample in batch sizes of 5 points to carry out
 the CAA simulation and acquire spectra from the space of slat position
 parameters.

Feature Extraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The feature extraction module was designed and implemented for our work
 using a Python workflow.
 Each of the simulated spectra was obtained at a frequency resolution of
 44Hz and was then fed into a Least Square fitting algorithm using the python
 package SciPy.
 The obtained feature extraction module is observed to be of sufficient
 accuracy to extract the broadband and tonal characteristics of the spectra
 and a few select cases are shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Featurextraction"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 In contrast, the true spectra has a large variance in the frequency domain,
 the obtained Guo's shape function fit is a smooth representation of the
 same.
 Regarding the peaks, the Lorentzian peak functions are a satisfactory fit
 for the actual tonal characteristics in a representative fashion.
 The convergence of the feature extractor to extract the central frequencies
 and peaks heights are also found to be satisfactory.
 However, from an aeroacoustic perspective, the broadening of a tonal peak
 has its own implications related to the convection of the waves, source
 effects, and effects of the presence of solid bodies which are all pertinent
 to the slat geometry case.
 In our study, this factor is not investigated and is hence not included
 in the design of the surrogate model.
 The typical broadband shape function also models the spectra such that
 there is a larger deviation at the lower frequencies which are considered
 to be the range where the background noises are prominent in a real experiment.
 This noise is minimal in the numerical case but the levels obtained using
 our simulations are still higher that modeled using the Guo's shape function.

Surrogate model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayesian Surrogate model approximates a high-dimensional map from the
 space of 4-dimensional positional parameters of the slat to the 17-dimensional
 representative variables for the far-field noise spectra.
 A measure of the accuracy of the model is the overall uncertainty of the
 model integrated over the domain of experimentation.
 This uncertainty however is not easily calculable since it involves computing
 the predictive variance over the 4D domain with sufficient resolution.
 Hence for a direct comparison on the predictive accuracy of the targets
 with training data and within the domain of interest, only the quantitative
 measures are useful whereas the graphical representation provides a qualitative
 idea of the accuracy.

The predicted parameters were then used to predict the model parameters
 of the spectra which were then used to reconstruct the spectra in deciBel

 With the availability of the first 10 data points, a prediction of the
 spectra is possible for any query point within the domain.
 Hence, to demonstrate the working of the model, a prediction on a randomly

 The four predictions shown are obtained by varying the initial noise parameter,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}(\%)=[50,5,1,0]$

 that is used to generate the model and the predicted variances are also
 proportional to the initial assumption according to Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 It can be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spectraN0"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 that if the initial noise is assumed to be 0%, then the predictive variance
 will also collapse to null leading to the GP model having 100% confidence
 in the training datapoints.
 The predicted response surface of this model fits the training target values
 exactly and hence leads to an exact reconstruction of the spectra.
 The resulting predictive variance is then zero and hence is absent in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:spectraN0"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 As the variable

 is increased, the predictive variance is also amplified accordingly.
 As can be noticed in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spectraN50"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, a sufficient initial noise assumption leads to a non-zero predictive variance
 as well as lower confidence of model in the training dataset.
 The non-zero variance assumption leads to a non-zero variance prediction
 for the response surface at the collocation points from training data and
 hence a slightly inaccurate prediction of the spectra.
 The inaccuracy is noticeable in the prediction of the central frequencies
 of the tones as they are visibly deviating from the original peaks in Fig.

 initial noise parameter is set to four different values are shown.
 The total estimate at a datapoint reduces to the aleatoric uncertainity
 by the nature of GP regression and hence is only sourced by the aleatoric
 uncertainity represented by the prior noise assumption in data through

The predictive variance for the broadband shape seems to have a good agreement
 even with a noise assumption of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}=5\%$
\end_inset

.
 However, the uncertainty for the peaks have a higher value on both sides
 of the peaks.
 This is due to the fact that in our routines, we only extract the central
 frequency and the peak height while modelling the peak using the Lorentzian
 peak function.
 This leaves out the peak width parameter that is kept constant and is hence
 not extracted from the training data or used in the prediction.
 This omission leads to a difference of levels between the predicted spectra
 and the modeled spectra on the both sides of the peak while the zenith
 is rightly modeled from the peak height.
 This problem is infact solvable by taking into account the peak width parameter
 in the regression, but the feature extraction procedure needs to take into
 account at total of 23 features instead of 17, and was found to be unstable
 during the feature extraction using least square fitting.
 An upgradation of this feature extraction technique using advanced methods
 must therefore eliminate the amplified variances on the slopes of the peaks
 resulting in a uniform predictive variance in the spectral domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It must also be mentioned that the noise assumption in the input data stems
 from the assumption of aleatoric uncertainty in the data acquisition and
 processing.
 However, the predictive variance represents the total uncertainty of the
 model prediction including the additional epistemic uncertainty arising
 from the Bayesian surrogate modelling.
 The fact that the initial noise assumption is necessary to obtain a non-zero
 predictive variance is due to the fact that in the Bayesian regression
 formalism, the predictive variance arises as a function of the initial
 noise assumption as seen in Eq.

Now that the inaccuracies arising from omission of peak width in the regression
 module and the effect of the noise parameter is understood, we choose to
 keep the noise parameter at 5% and assess the overall variance of the model
 over the chosen domain of the slat positional parameters.
 For this the model is used to make predictions of the target variables
 and the spectra is reconstructed for collocations points on a uniform grid
 in the 4D domain.
 We call this the test domain and is the same as defined by Table.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 Also, for computing the total uncertainty for each spectra, we integrate
 the predicted variance over a range of [100, 20000]Hz, and this sum, without
 averaging over the frequency domain, is what we call Total Spectral Variance
 (TSV) as defined in Eq.

.
 This value is then obtained over the discretized test domain whose grid
 size is kept at 8 points within the corresponding interval for each variable.
 In the initial state of the model using 10 input points, the TSV is obtained
 at 68.84 dBdB.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Total Spectral Variance distribution over the test domain is a measure
 of the statistical accuracy of the surrogate model, expressing the total
 epistemic uncertainty.
 Hence the Mean Total Spectral Variance (MTSV) can be used to monitor the
 progress of the surrogate model during the course of the active learning
 procedure.
 The active learning model is then used to progressively update the model
 to obtain a reduction on the MTSV until satisfactory convergence.
 Here, as an experiment we choose to use a batch size of 5 simulations to
 sample the spectra.
 Note that although the sample size is set to 5 for each set, the number
 of successful simulations can be lesser due to technical errors and on
 average is maintained at 4.
 The evolution of the MTSV with respect to the active learning steps during
 the initial stages of the model development are shown in Fig.

 Additionally to monitor the sampling of points, we choose to visualize
 the 4D domain using a dimensionality reduction using t-Stochastic Neighbor
 Embedding.
 The visualization allows to monitor the relation between the sampled points
 and the points in the dataset based on their Eulerian distance in the 4D
 domain.
 Here the clustering of the points represents close proximities and the
 sampling is monitored to generate points which maintains a compromise between
 conformance to the clustering (exploitation) and sufficiently balancing
 the different clusters (exploration).

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
A method for automating the exploration of parameter space of slat positioning
 with respect to the airfoil was developed for the particular application
 to aeroacoustic investigation.
 By no means we claim the optimality of the design of the current state
 of this approach but is an experimental step towards a more advanced applicatio
n in the domain.
 Currently, a framework which is able to handle the spectral data – including
 the broadband components and the tonal peaks – as the target features and
 slat coordinates as the input variable is developed by appropriate feature
 extractions.
 Then a Gaussian Process Regression is used to obtain a surrogate model
 of the available data.
 Gaussian Processes being a statistical regression tool based on the Bayesian
 formalism, a measure of uncertainty of the model is implicitly available
 along with its concurrent state.
 This epistemic uncertainty is high during the initial phase of the exploration
 and the sampling process is then adapted to minimize this uncertainty.
 A few methods to leverage the uncertainty information and obtain an optimal
 sampling were attempted and finally the Upper Confidence Bound method is
 chosen for the current application.
 Consequently a roadmap for uncertainty calculations for the spectra predictions
 are also developed that are extensible to more complex scenarios.
 The algorithm is then shown to carry out exploration where the model is
 pinned to the most noisy configuration which is close to the standard slat
 positioning.
 The epistemic uncertainty is then shown to have a monotonic decrease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
As for demonstration of the model, a few predictions based on parametric
 variation of the slat overlap and slat gap is made.
 Variation of the spectra for the strength of the peak and the distribution
 of energy between the peaks can be observed.
 For an progressive increase of the slat overlap from extreme value of -15.0
 to -4.0, the surrogate model predicts the standard spectra as the base line.
 For further increase from -3.0 to -2.0, a region where data is available
 from the dataset, the peaks show a decrease in the resonant frequency as
 expected.
 This consistent with the fact that the increase in overlap leads to additionall
y skewed shear layer path length which is longer in length and thus reduce
 the Rossiter frequencies due to higher vortex travel times.
 The effect is nullified and the model returns to standard spectra as the
 slat overlap is further increased to -1.0 where data is not available in
 the dataset.
 Note that the prediction now can be made for any continuous trajectory
 in the parameter space.

That being demonstrated that the model is fully viable for a data-driven
 noise surrogate model for industrial cases, it is imperative to delineate
 the limitations of the current implementation.
 The surrogate model currently has been fed with only few datapoints, i.e.
 18 data points.
 This occurred due to the technical difficulties and to obtain a fully viable
 surrogate model, the simulation based on active learning must be continued
 for sufficient number of acquisitions such that the Mean Total Spectral
 Variance is converged to the best possible value.
 Further improvements can also be made in the design of acquisition function,
 in accordance with the evolving literature, such that the active learning
 methodology itself is improved leading to a higher sample efficiency.
 However this is beyond the scope of our work within the premise of the
 slat noise investigation.
 Thus although the surrogate model is used for exploring the parameter space
 utilizing the Bayesian sampling technique, the model itself is declared
 as requiring further accuracy before deployment for use in the HLD design
 setting.

Now, for the continuation of slat noise investigation, the aeroacoustic
 LBM simulations that we conducted were used to record pertinent information
 regarding the flow dynamics.
 These datasets thus allows for a fundamental analysis into the flow dynamics.
 This will be attempted in the upcoming chapter.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayesian framework together with ProLB and FWH modules explained in
 the previous chapter enables a computational investigation of the slat
 noise phenomena with unprecedented detail.
 The Bayesian Active Learning method is a numerical twin for a real-time
 experimenter who samples simulations based on the uncertainity of the noise
 surrogate model within any selected domain.
 The special application to aeroacoustics that we designed in this work
 approximates the acoustic data in the form of far-field spectra as a function
 of the position of slat with respect to the main element.
 A spectra is thus predicted by the model for any slat position along with
 a measure of its own epistemic uncertainity.
 A stochastic Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm then ensures that the
 model's exploration is always pinned to the noisiest case and hence collects
 data which are relevant to the noise characteristics.
 While this framework paves way to an optimal and automated aeroacoustic
 design optimization, in our current activity, we also enable data recording
 such that the phenomenology of cove dynamics can be investigated.
 This chapter is dedicated to this exploration of the dataset, with the
 ambition to manually elaborate on the the newly found cove dynamics.
 For this we focus particularly on the spanwise modulations of spanwise
 component of velocity, their periodic bursting behaviors at diverging planes,
 and how they affect the slat noise characteristics, and deploy comparative
 analysis across cases by varying the slat positioning for the standard
 VALIANT

 geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As pilot investigation, we used the case of standard positioning of the
 slat in Chapter 3 to demonstrate that the spanwise modulations, that are
 newly found in the cove flow, suggests that the recirculation bubble has
 a non-homogeneous distribution of both time-averaged velocity and pressure
 along the spanwise direction.
 These modulations are also shown to be attached to the curved shear layer
 during its early spatial development although the whole volume of the cove
 remains modulated by phase-inverted arrangement of these cells.
 The presence of periodic inversion of spanwise velocity along the span
 also necessitates a mechanism that allows the stability of the converging
 and diverging planes which acts as sources and sinks for the spanwise flow.
 Here, the streamwise oriented small-scale recirculating structures are
 entrained by the shear layer and the recirculation resupplies them back
 into the cove.
 However, in view of the 1-dimensional spanwise dynamics, the velocity with
 which the shear layer entrains the structures from a spanwise converging
 plane is approximately the free stream velocity outside shear layer, but
 the velocity responsible for replenishment of the diverging planes is the
 velocity of recirculation.
 The former is higher than the latter, the difference being quantitatively
 captured by the velocity ratio, and hence a mass and pressure deficit develops
 in the diverging planes of spanwise velocity.
 We theorized in the Chapter 04 that this leads to the low frequency 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bursting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the cove at the diverging planes and demonstrated that this frequency
 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $St\approx0.16$
\end_inset

.
 
\color black
This was the case when the slat position is standard without additional
 deformation of the shear layer by variation of the slat position with respect
 to main element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To understand this low frequency oscillation and its effects, the unsteady
 velocity inside the cove has to be studied.
 Since the cove flow and the impingement location have quasi-periodic oscillator
y motions
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "KamliyaJawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 the time-averaged velocity field removes relevant information.
 Hence the unsteady velocity fluctuations need to be studied using the spanwise
 variation of its spectral components which can be computed using probe
 recordings and used to extract the behavior in parametric cases as the
 slat position is varied.
 This will be one objective of the discussions in this chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important aspect of the cove dynamics which is related to slat acoustics
 is the vorticity transfer from 2D spanwise coherent structures in early
 shear layer to the smaller scale streamwise structures towards the slat
 gap.
 It is clear that the spanwise coherent vortex structures are responsible
 for driving the aeroacoustic resonance.
 However, this spanwise vorticity is not fully preserved as the shear layer
 develops towards the impingement location.
 The streamwise vortex structures from the recirculation interacts with
 the shear layer from the early development near the cusp and intertwines
 with spanwise structures to form a ladder structure.
 Towards impingement, the spanwise vorticity is thus largely converted to
 streamwise vorticity, the latter being a less efficient source of noise,
 both by driving an aeroacoustic loop or by trailing edge scattering.
 Extrapolating this scenario, we put forward the case that if the vorticity
 conversion effect is strong enough such that the reminiscent spanwise coherent
 vortex core that impinges the upper slat wall is weaker than that required
 to excite a resonance, the Rossiter tones can disappear.
 In between the extreme cases, it should also be possible to obtain a progressiv
e suppression of the tones thereby obtaining a model for the strength of
 the tones together with already available frequency prediction using Rossiter
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More importantly, and apart from this vortex dynamics which are clearly
 notable in the visualizations of simulation data, we also conjectured in
 this work that the fundamental driver of vorticity conversion to streamwise
 direction is not the interference by the entrainment of streamwise recirculatin
g vorticity but is an effect of the shear layer curvature.
 In this direction, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wang2023"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 previously showed that Görtler-like instability of the shear layer due
 to strong unstable curvature near the trailing edge can occur in case of
 low Reynolds numbers where the spanwise vortex shedding is weak.
 Early works of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bradshaw1969,Bradshaw2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, and more recently 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, have shown that a curved shear layer is linearly unstable due to the effect
 of curvature and can develop streamwise oriented vorticity by developing
 spanwise instability modes.
 Bradshaw also drew parallels between the case of a buoyancy driven flow
 under density stratification and a shear layer development under action
 of centrifugal force.
 Their studies both suggest that a formulation of the curvature Richardson
 number can quantitatively capture the transfer of vorticity between streamwise
 and spanwise directions, if the flow is within linear approximations.
 Nevertheless, in contrast, the length scales and flow magnitudes in the
 slat flow case suggests that the curvature effects in cove dynamics should
 be strongly non-linear and saturated.
 Hence, the interactions cannot be accurately captured using a simplified
 formulation of the Richardson number.
 In how much the curvature Richardson number, or a cumulative history of
 the same along the shear layer path, can represent the relative strength
 of tones is thus the second objective of discussions in this chapter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For structuring the discussions we utilize Section 2 to discuss the mean
 flow fields from the dataset to understand the different flow cases and
 to identify a few particular cases for a more detailed analysis.
 In Section 3, the acoustic predictions for each of the cases are documented
 to understand how the far-field noise can be related to the mean flow fields.
 In Section 4, we extract the shear layer shape from the mean flow for each
 of the cases available using methods explained in Chapter 4.
 In Section 5, 6, and 7, we choose 4 interesting cases and discuss the newly
 observed spanwise modes and their low frequency oscillations to establish
 the relations between the shear layer shapes and these behaviors.
 In Section 8, we include a few additional cases that we simulated during
 our investigation to improve the argument that the effect of the shear
 layer shape and the curvature Richardson number can explain the the variability
 of the tonal nature of slat noise.
 In Section 9, we also attempt to provide an estimation of the Strouhal
 number based on the details available from the dataset.

 It is to be noted in particular that the mean fields are not averaged along
 the spanwise direction.
 This is due to the fact that the simulations were designed without prior
 knowledge of the spanwise modulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the collection of shear layer shapes, the first observation is the
 sensitivity of shear layer shapes to the position of the slat.
 Clearly the shear layer shape is influenced by all three coordinates of
 the slat simultaneously, but it is the slat overlap which principally determine
 the shape of the shear layer while the slat deflection angle determines
 the initial curvature of the shear layer.
 The slat gap in contrast primarily affect the peak ejection velocity more
 than other characteristics and hence deemed as most important for the broadband
 noise level
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Guo2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 For the shear layer shape alone, the slat overlap determines the horizontal
 proximity of the slat to the main element and when increased with respect
 to standard slat position, the shear layer is forced to have a low initial
 curvature and stronger curvature at mid-length as the flow is redirected
 to flow through the slat gap.

\begin_layout Standard
A particular case of high overlap is the Case 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

.
 Here, the flow at the cusp is largely aligned with the incoming flow along
 the outer wall of the slat cusp and is not immediately redirected as for
 the standard case.
 Instead the curvature is minimal in the initial region with a strong curvature
 appearing in the mid-trajectory and closer to the main element.
 In Case 4, the slat gap is also particularly reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $4\,mm$
\end_inset

 which reduces the ejected flow velocity to 
\begin_inset Formula $60\,m/s$
\end_inset

 which is a case of severe chocking when compared to the standard geometry
 which has an ejection speed close to 
\begin_inset Formula $110\,m/s$
\end_inset

.
 This reduction of speed leads this case to have a strong deviation from
 the standard noise profile, both for the broadband levels and the Rossiter
 tones which is expected since the broadband noise trailing edge noise scales
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{5}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the same direction, Case 
\begin_inset Formula $11$
\end_inset

 can be noted to have a less skewed shear layer shape with the impingement
 point closer to the trailing edge.
 Hence, the latter can be expected to have a slightly improved source efficiency
 for both broadband and tonal components.
 An even further improvement on the same is Case 
\begin_inset Formula $19$
\end_inset

, which despite having a reduced initial curvature has a more evenly distributed
 curvature with the impingement point close to the slat trailing edge.
 As shown from the comparison of spectra in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:shearlayercomp9_11_19"

\end_inset

, this significantly recovers the broadband and tonal characteristics.
 Note that the comparison is made by changing the shear layer shape but
 keeping the free-stream velocity and angle of attack constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A case of high initial curvature of the mean shear layer is Case 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

.
 This high curvature is due to the fact that the slat overlap is high together
 with a sufficient slat gap such that the flow is strongly redirected from
 the cusp towards the slat gap.
 Such high initial curvatures and high mean velocity along the shear layer
 leads to higher growth rates for the centrifugal related instability.
 However, in addition to this effect, the impingement point is deeper into
 the cove in this case as compared to the standard noisy configuration and
 hence the impinging vortices have a strong interaction with the turbulent
 region of impingement.
 Therefore, the spanwise coherence is significantly reduced before the flow
 approaches the trailing edge.
 This case hence have have a low efficiency source for the tonal and broadband
 components.
 Similar cases are Case 
\begin_inset Formula $[8,9,12,14,27,28,\text{ and }30]$
\end_inset

, whose impingement location is too upstream from the trailing edge to enable
 a strong noise source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cases with a strong characteristic broadband and tonal characteristics
 are those which are close to the standard geometry.
 The characteristic shear layer shape for this noisy configuration is clearly
 identifiable from the dataset.
 The main characteristics include a uniform distribution of the curvature
 magnitude together with a high ejection velocity, which in the standard
 noisy case is twice that of the free stream.
 Specifically, in the dataset probed by the Bayesian model, the most noisy
 case is Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

.
 This case is acoustically similar to the standard positioning with the
 same angle of attack.
 The difference is that the slat is moved further outward from the main
 element due to a reduced slat overlap and also maintains a higher slat
 gap.
 The slat deflection angle is also decreased enabling the shed vortices
 to be convected along a moderately curved path to the the slat trailing
 edge.
 The positioning of the impingement location is also such that the vortical
 structures have minimal interaction with the stagnated turbulent region
 of the impingement by being convected directly to the trailing edge, but
 inevitably, the mean shear layer streamline from the cusp has incidence
 on the trailing edge wall.
 These characteristics renders Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

 the most noisy in the dataset.
 This case is hence is taken as the base case for comparative analysis from
 here on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To elaborate further, we must discuss the numerical calculations based on
 the mean shear layer and before this we take a quick detour to discuss
 the details of the observed acoustic characteristics in the upcoming subsection
 for completeness.

For the given VALIANT geometry and Reynolds number, the first major tone
 can be noticed at approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $1771\,Hz$
\end_inset

 for Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

 similar to the experiment.
 A lower frequency hump is also suspected at 
\begin_inset Formula $1771/2=885\,Hz$
\end_inset

 as suggested by the first Rossiter mode calculation according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Terracol2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, however not noticeable in the experiment.
 This hump is usually not noticeable in experimental studies since at frequencie
s close to and less than 
\begin_inset Formula $800\,Hz$
\end_inset

, the noise from jet shear layer issued from the wall lips of the tunnel
 and other installation noises are prominent.
 This noise floor is not present in the simulations of the airfoil in free-strea
m and the low frequency hump is hence noticeable for most of the noisy cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary observation from the comparative analyses that can be deduced
 from the full dataset (see Appendix B) is that the Rossiter mode frequencies
 can be seen to be prominent only for cases that have an impingement location
 close to the slat trailing edge.
 For Cases 
\begin_inset Formula $[4,5,6,8,9,28,\text{ and }30]$
\end_inset

, the Rossiter modes are absent along with a significantly lower broadband
 component.
 In cases where the Rossiter tones are prominent, the frequency of modes
 show variations with respect to the slat positioning.
 Compared to the Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

, Cases 
\begin_inset Formula $[7,15,16,\text{ and }17]$
\end_inset

 (see Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cases7_15_16_17"

\end_inset

 and Appendix B) shows a significant shift of all the tones.
 It can also be noted that the shift of frequency of the tones are not equal
 for all the tones.
 The first five Rossiter modes which are multiples of the fundamental at
 
\begin_inset Formula $885\,Hz$
\end_inset

 have a higher correlation in the frequency shift than the sixth tone at
 approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $6500\,Hz$
\end_inset

.
 This sixth tone also shows anomaly by being present in the cases which
 have a deformed shear layer as in the case of Cases 
\begin_inset Formula $[4,12,27,\text{ and }30]$
\end_inset

, while other Rossiter tones and the broadband noise is absent.
 This suggest that the mechanism underlying this sixth tone is different
 from the aeroacoustic resonance loop.
 The source of this separate tone in the absence of a resonance loop is
 also not previously identified but is suspected as due to the oscillations
 at the trailing edge or possibly a spurious component arising from the
 trailing edge of the main element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
Another interesting observation from the spectra dataset is that our choice
 of spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{z}=0.2\,m$
\end_inset

 has an implication for the predicted spectra.
 For an acoustic wave of this wavelength, the corresponding frequency is
 
\begin_inset Formula $1715\,Hz$
\end_inset

 and the fundamental of this tone is at 
\begin_inset Formula $1715/2=858\,Hz$
\end_inset

 – only 
\begin_inset Formula $5\%$
\end_inset

 lower than the Rossiter mode.
 The higher harmonics then follow the formula for harmonics as 
\begin_inset Formula $f=N\frac{2c}{L_{z}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the acoustic speed, and the set of frequencies corresponding to a stationary
 wave in the spanwise domain will be 
\begin_inset Formula $[2574,3432,4290,\text{ and }5148]\,Hz$
\end_inset

.
 These frequencies are marked in all plots for far-field spectra in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cases7_15_16_17"

\end_inset

 demonstrating the fact that as the slat position is varied with respect
 to the airfoil, the frequencies may or may not match with these spanwise
 characteristics.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Cases }[7,15,16,17,19,20,26,29]$
\end_inset

 are examples in which the slat positioning leads to a different set of
 frequencies with the peaks maintaining the same amplitudes as for the standard
 case.
 This serves the argument that the spanwise domain size of the simulation,
 although possibly imposing similar characteristic frequencies, are not
 a reason for the existence of such tones.
 That being said, it is possible that most noisy configuration, Case 22,
 and the configuration in close proximity to the same in the slat coordinate
 system may tend to have a spurious numerical bias towards selection of
 frequencies depending on the spanwise length of the simulation.
 However, given that the same-span simulations with varying slat positions
 renders a variety of frequency selections, this is only a remote possibility
 and not pursued further.

\begin_layout Section
Shear Layer Curvature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shape of mean shear layer of the slat is best captured by the distribution
 of its local curvature.
 In a 2D view of the flow, this curvature can be calculated two ways: one
 is using the mean velocity contour to extract the streamline curvature
 over a given plane and second by using the mean streamline along the shear
 layer.
 To obtain the curvature on a 2D plane using only the mean velocity field,
 a local inviscid assumption is necessary.
 Under this assumption which is largely valid only for the external flow
 around the slat, we can assume a balance of forces along a streamline such
 that the pressure gradient balances the centrifugal forces generated due
 to curvature.
 Then 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial n}=\rho\frac{U^{2}}{R}\label{eq:pressure_bal_curvr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the radially outward normal to the streamline and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the local streamline curvature.
 Given that the streamline normal is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{-U_{y}\hat{i}+U_{x}\hat{j}}{U}$
\end_inset

, the streamline normal pressure gradient becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial p}{\partial n}=\frac{U_{x}}{U}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}-\frac{U_{y}}{U}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
thereby obtaining the local streamline curvature as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{\rho U^{2}}\left[\frac{U_{x}}{U}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}-\frac{U_{y}}{U}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A contour plot of the calculated curvatures inside the cove flow is shown
 in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meancurvaturecontour"

\end_inset

 for Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

.
 As can be noted, for the region inside the shear layer, the curvature computed
 using Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pressure_bal_curvr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 computes a strong clockwise curvature.
 This streak of strong curvature is spurious in the calculation as, evidently
 from the velocity distribution, the streamline does not follow a path of
 the indicated curvatures.
 Hence the numerical values are evidently excessive of the actual curvature
 and is due to the fact that in the inner shear layer, the centrifugal forces
 are not indeed balanced by the pressure gradient but by the viscous momentum
 diffusion.
 By virtue of the latter, the balance is finally achieved by developing
 streamwise vorticity which convects fluid across the streamline accelerating
 the momentum diffusion to produce additional dynamic forces and thereby
 equilibrium.
 This hence strongly violates Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:pressure_bal_curvr"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, leading to erroneous calculation of the curvature for all cases.
 In simple terms, the inviscid assumption is too exacting in the case of
 cove flow whose shear layer undergoes a three dimensional vorticity transitions
 inside the recirculation.
 Nevertheless, the locations of impingement are clearly notable from the
 curvature inflection on the walls as shown in Fig.

This local curvature however is not valid inside the cove region where the
 chord based Reynolds number drops by 
\begin_inset Formula $30%\%
$
\end_inset

, assuming a recirculation velocity of atleast 
\begin_inset Formula $15 m/sm/s$
\end_inset

.
 The Dean number which typically captures the ratio of the centrifugal forces
 to the viscous forces given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\operatorname{De}=Re\sqrt{\frac{D}{2R_{c}}}$
\end_inset

 also collapse to the same order of the Reynolds number since the radius
 of streamline curvature is of same magnitude as that for the slat chord.
 This regime of Dean number is fully turbulent, and hence the inviscid assumptio
n is incorrect only close to the center of recirculation, making the curvature
 thus calculated to be a useful tool to understand the centrifugal effect.
 The images of local streamline curvatures are shown in Fig.

The second way to calculate local curvature is by using geometrical formula
 on a select mean streamline.
 For the same, we first extract the point coordinates of the mean streamlines.
 The geometrical curvature is then calculated as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
R & =\left[\left(\frac{\partial^{2}x}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\partial^{2}y}{\partial s^{2}}\right)^{2}\right]^{-\frac{1}{2}}\label{eq:curvreqn}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where, 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the path length along the streamline.
 A more elaborate account of the path line calculation and curvature are
 provided in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The geometrical curvature is free from the hydrodynamic calculations and
 hence it is free from the approximations for inviscid flow.
 The computed curvature is plotted for each case and is available in Appendix
 B.
 A few select cases are given in Fig.

Here, the numerical value of curvature provides a more agreeable picture
 of the streamline curvature.
 Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

, which is the most noisy case can be noted to be one with an average curvature
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $30\,m^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The curvature corresponding to inverse slat chord is 
\begin_inset Formula $25.6\,m^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and hence the shear layer in all noisy cases have the mean curvature as
 same order of magnitude as the inverse slat chord.
 Good examples of such cases are Case 
\begin_inset Formula $[7,10,13,15,20,21,22,23,24,29,\text{ and }31]$
\end_inset

.
 To enable a useful comparison, we choose to use the streamline path length
 until the position of the slat trailing edge as the standard length.
 All cases are then standardized using this length obtaining the trailing
 edge location at 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0$
\end_inset

 such that the noise characteristics can be compared based on the behavior
 near the trailing edge.

\begin_layout Standard
The main characteristics of the curvature distribution on the streamline
 are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The magnitude of curvature has atleast one null point along the shear layer
 where the direction of curvature inverts.
 This occurs when the initial shear layer which is redirected towards the
 slat gap has to correct the curvature in order to redirect the flow through
 the slat gap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Depending on the proximity of the slat with respect to the main element,
 and if the initial curvature is insufficient, the curvature can spike before
 the inflection point, as in Case 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

.
 This is particularly the case when the slat overlap is increased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Upon impingement the streamline enters a region of strong turbulence which
 also have low frequency and intermittent behaviors.
 The region is also close to the slat wall where the mean flow solution
 is not well converged using the 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 chord pass times used to average the flow.
 This leads to noise in the streamline calculated using the mean flow and
 therefore the curvature calculation has a strong error.
 Case 
\begin_inset Formula $[4,5,6,25,27,\text{ and }28]$
\end_inset

 can be noted to have this problem after the impingement location.
 These cases have a high slat overlap leading to the impingement point being
 far inside the cavity also attenuating both tonal and broadband characteristic
 noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The vortex impingement location on the slat upper wall will generate a strong
 curvature.
 This spike in curvature is the second sharp peak after the first inflection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curvature profiles thus analyzed is very much in agreement with the
 qualitative deductions in the previous sections.
 More precisely, a shear layer which maintains a curvature lower or same
 order of magnitude as inverse slat chord with the most delayed point of
 inflection, which consequently leads to a delayed impingement location
 closest to slat trailing edge, tend to be a more efficient noise generator.
 The proximity of the impingement location, identifiable as a feature from
 the curvature profile also has a strong influence on the noise levels.
 A good example is the comparison of Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

 and Case 
\begin_inset Formula $26$
\end_inset

 as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:streamlinecurvature-2"

\end_inset

.
 For Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

, the trajectory have a regularized curvature with the impingement location
 close to the trailing edge, while for Case 
\begin_inset Formula $26$
\end_inset

, the impingement location is moved to the interior.
 For the latter, although the exit velocity is higher at the slat gap, the
 noise levels are lower than Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

, suggesting that the location of impingement plays a crucial role in determinin
g the source efficiency.
 Moreover, in addition to the effect of impingement at the wall, the region
 around the impingement by nature of the centrifugal instability leads to
 a reduction of spanwise coherence of structures.
 Hence we theorized that the curvature history prior to the trailing edge
 is the noise-determining feature and not the impingement location by itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being the observations based on raw curvature along the streamline,
 the centrifugal effects also depends on the streamline velocity.
 A shear layer that maintains a higher streamline velocity must therefore
 accrue a larger effect of centrifugal instability, which here is the generation
 of streamwise vortices at the expense of spanwise vorticity.
 Therefore, we proceed to investigate shear layer shapes based on the suggestion

As mentioned in the introduction, an early work looking into the fundamental
 problem of the effect of curvature on the turbulence characteristics can
 be seen in attempt by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 It was then deduced that the curvature effects are significant if the shear
 layer thickness exceeds 
\begin_inset Formula $1/300^{th}$
\end_inset

 of the radius of curvature.
 From the characterization of curvatures, we can deduce that the streamline
 curvature of the slat shear layer is of the same order as that of the slat
 chord and consequently a shear layer thickness of 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times10^{-4}\,m$
\end_inset

 will be large enough to be unstable.
 From the observation of the slat flow cases, the standard initial shear
 layer thickness is of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}\,m$
\end_inset

 as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:shearlayercurvature"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:04_The_VALIANT_Case"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, suggesting that the curvature must have a non-trivial effect.
 The effect also becomes increasingly significant as the shear layer spreads
 towards the impingement where the curvature is maximized and the shear
 layer thickness is large enough to be fully unstable.
 A later work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bradshaw2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 suggested that a curved streamline will also have the same dynamic balance
 between curvature driven centrifugal force and fluid dynamic forces as
 in the case of forces with density stratified flows.
 For the latter, the buoyancy force appears as a source term in the momentum
 equations whereas for curved streamlines the centrifugal force appears
 as a source term when the Navier-Stokes momentum equations are written
 in the streamline coordinates.
 The equivalence of terms were then exploited to obtain an equivalent curvature-
Richardson number such that it can capture the effect of curvature on the
 streamline turbulence.

In the work of

\end_inset

 using linear stability analysis, the effect of curvature on a slightly
 curved shear layer was shown to have two important effects: first being
 a partial stabilization of the K-H instability due to the curvature and
 the other being the existence of curvature driven steady spanwise modes.
 For the latter, the curvature is particularly identified as unstable if
 the Rayleigh criterion is satisfied, i.e.
 if the angular momentum decreases radially outward across the curvature.
 From the distribution of mean flow in the slat cove, we can deduce that
 this condition is satisfied only in the later part of the shear layer towards
 the impingement region.
 This is due to the high velocity stream being on the concave side of the
 curvature in the slat gap and hence qualitatively explains the generation
 of the streamwise vorticity in this region.
 Now, to obtain a quantitative measure of how curvature affects the shear
 layer, the linearized streamline equations in curvilinear coordinates were
 used by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to obtain the kinetic energy production terms in streamwise and spanwise
 direction.
 The ratio of the same then capture the vorticity transfer into streamwise
 structures.
 This ratio also came out as the curvature Richardson number as originally
 suggested by

where,

 Here the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U}{R}=\frac{1}{ds}\left[\frac{U^{2}}{R}\frac{ds}{U}\right]$
\end_inset

 a unit distance under the influence of centrifugal force 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{U^{2}}{R}$
\end_inset

.
 A more elaborate thought on the works of Bradshaw and Liou and why their
 ideas are valid for the slat cove dynamics is given in Chapter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curvature Richardson number profiles along the shear layer for a few
 select cases are shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:curvature_richardson-3-1"

\end_inset

 and a full dataset is given in Appendix B.
 A first case of interest with a clearly interpretable result is with Case
 18 and 25, and is shown separately in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:curvature_richardsonCase18"

\end_inset

.
 This case clearly have a positive slat overlap with a reduced slat gap
 leading to choking of the flow.
 However, the tonal noise components are still evident, particularly the
 third and fourth tones which show a strong SPL above the mean noise levels.
 
\color black
This hints at the nature of non-linear interaction between the harmonic
 tones such that the first two tones transfer energy to the higher order
 modes.
 Such non-linear interactions were discussed recently in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Wei2025"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The same effect can be noticed in Case 25, which has an improved exit velocity
 but still less than Case 23 for example.
 Hence Case 25 also have a diminished broadband level and the third and
 the fourth tone maintains the same SPL as the most noisy Case 22.
 Interestingly these cases exhibit an increase in the curvature Richardson
 number owing to the effect of sharp curvature near the impingement.
 As can be inferred from the Richardson number plot, the impingement points
 for both these cases are slightly more upstream along the wall from the
 trailing edge than the standard Case 22, and shows the non-linear tonal
 relations at multiple flow exit velocities.
 However, despite our best efforts, a more direct relationship between the
 curvature effect and the non-linear frequency couplings are still elusive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can also be noted that the Richardson numbers are higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1$
\end_inset

 on average along the shear layers for all cases.
 In comparison, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 identified curvature instabilities for the case of slightly curved shear
 layers whose Richardson numbers were in the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 For the noisy case Case 22, the Richardson number has an initial value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1$
\end_inset

 and rises to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.9$
\end_inset

 before the curvature inflection.
 The region after the inflection, which then satisfies the Rayleigh criteria,
 maintains the Richardson number above 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2$
\end_inset

 until impingement close to the trailing edge.
 This region between the curvature inflection and the impingement is hence
 where the shear layer vorticity is unstable due to the centrifugal effects
 and therefore lead to rapid generation of streamwise structures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On observing the same region for the Richardson numbers in the noisy cases
 in the dataset, it can be observed that Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

 maintains a lower bound for the Richardson number for this region i.e.
 all other cases which have the characteristic broadband and tonal components
 but with a lower SPL over the broadband range tend to maintain a higher
 Richardson number in the region before the impingement.
 Hence it can be inferred that the lowest Richardson number is one factor
 than contributes to the noise efficiency of Case 22 by allowing higher
 spanwise coherence.
 However again, to infer the contribution of curvature quantitatively requires
 a more meticulous approach since the broadband noise is primarily dependent
 on the exit velocity past the slat trailing edge.
 In Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:curvature_richardson-3-1"

\end_inset

, a few select cases are shown which have a similar exit velocity but with
 a variation of the sound levels.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On comparing Case 24 with Case 26 with reference Case 22, the exit velocity
 magnitude in the slat gap for Case 24 is lower than that of Case 26.
 But the noise level of Case 24 is higher and agrees well with Case 22.
 On comparing their Richardson number profiles, the Case 24 and 22 agrees
 closely whereas for Case 26, the curvature inflection point occurs earlier
 in the shear layer.
 Hence the Case 26 has more length along the shear layer which is unstable
 to the centrifugal instability thereby leading to a sharp reduction of
 the spanwise coherence.
 Now comparing Case 26 to Case 31, there is a smoother evolution of the
 shear layer shape for Case 31 than the former since for this case the impingeme
nt location is closer to the trailing edge.
 Hence the effect of impingement is further reduced than Case 26 thereby
 recovering the spectra closer to the standard case.
 However, despite the exit velocity being still higher than Case 24, the
 Case 31 does not recover the same levels.
 This suggest that the effect of curvature driven decoherence holds relevance
 for the noise efficiency in addition to the exit velocity and the proximity
 of impingement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hence the Richardson number comparison with the most noisy cases can conspicuous
ly suggest the noise efficiency of the case.
 A Richardson number profile in the critical region similar to Case 22,
 the most noisy configuration, together with the location of the impingement
 location closest to the trailing edge suggest that the broadband noise
 and tonal levels will be similar, despite the fact that the tonal frequencies
 can be shifted based on the total length of the shear layer.
 This comparison hence suggest that the streamline curvature magnitude,
 as theorized, has a significant effect on the noise efficiency of the configura
tion.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

However, an acoustic model or a quantitative correction based on the curvature
 profile is rather more subtle since the actual noise efficiency is much
 more strongly affected by the location of the impingement which occurs
 rather simultaneously with increased curvature effects.
 The normal pressure gradient calculation also have a high sensitivity near
 the impingement location since stagnation pressure near impingement causes
 a distortion of the pressure profile such that the normal pressure gradient
 is not representative of the pressure gradient in the shear layer.
 Therefore, although we demonstrate the role of the curvature in the vorticity
 conversion and noise efficiency, a practical acoustic model must rely comprehen
sively on all of the other factors too and thus the noise computation method
 using LBM-FWH approach or surrogate modelling is still suggested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being the effect of vorticity transfer due to curvature, another effect
 of the streamline curvature is the generation of larger scale spanwise
 vorticity cells.
 This is explored in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This process in our theory is responsible for the noisy efficiency thereby
 reducing the noise source efficiency.
 For the noisy cases, it can be noted that curvature inflection occurs at
 approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $70\%$
\end_inset

 of the path length from the cusp to the trailing edge.
 This case also have the maximum Richardson number at the location of the
 Trailing edge owing to the impulsive correction of the streamline direction
 as it passes along the sharp trailing edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Given that Case 22 is a noisy configuration, the curvature Richardson number
 profile serves as a base line to assess other cases.
 If the history of Richardson number for a case is such that it accrues
 a significant excess of the same, it suggests that the vorticity transfer
 was also accelerated during the traversal along the shear layer.
 Such a case will therefore have a larger proportion of the streamwise vorticity
 at the trailing edge thereby reducing the efficiency of acoustic scattering
 by the trailing edge.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For cases including Case 
\begin_inset Formula $[4,6,\text{ and }27]$
\end_inset

 where the impingement location is away from the trailing edge and into
 the cove, the calculation of curvature gains noise in the location after
 impingement as mentioned earlier.
 This noise carries over to the Richardson number plots, however only suggesting
 that such a region prior to the trailing edge location definitively suggest
 a strongly turbulent region involving majorly streamwise vortices and hence
 with a weak noise characteristic.
 It is evident from the comparison of any generic case, that the impingement
 location is the closest to the trailing edge for Case 22.
 This proximity maintained only in Case 19, which upon inspection of its
 mean flow shows a different ejection velocity due to narrowing of the slat
 gap, however with only slightly weaker broadband characteristics.
 This suggests that the proximity of the impingement to the trailing edge
 can effectively compensate the reduction of noise intensity due to a reduced
 exit velocity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
From comparison of the cases, it is hence clear that Richardson number profile
 of the shear layer, together with exit velocity and the impingement location
 can explain the broadband noise levels.
 However, the local Richardson number at the exit plane is not a physically
 consistent explanation of the same since the centrifugal effect enables
 the related vorticity conversion over the course of the trajectory.
 Hence a history of the Richardson number or more formally the cumulative
 integral of Richardson number is deemed as appropriate choice.
 For this we plot the cumulative Richardson number as a function of the
 streamline path length in Fig.??.

The second characteristic cove flow phenomena that we are particularly intereste
d is the existence of spanwise modes.
 As shown for the standard positioning of the slat in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:04_The_VALIANT_Case"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, the spanwise velocity inside the cove close to the shear layer tends to
 develop a spanwise modulation with amplitudes upto 
\begin_inset Formula $0.15\,U_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
 This leads to formation of converging and diverging planes which necessitate
 that a mass continuity is established between them.
 However, this continuity cannot be met since the outer stream entrains
 the flow from the converging planes faster than the inner low speed recirculati
on which replenishes the diverging planes leading to periodic bursting of
 the cove.
 This periodic bursting were shown to have a slat chord based Strouhal number
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $St=0.156$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $200\,Hz$
\end_inset

) for the standard slat position and will be investigated for all the cases
 in the dataset.

One critical parameter related to the spanwise modes is its wave number.
 In the case of backward facing step studied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Barkley2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, spanwise wavelength was approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx7$
\end_inset

 times the step height.
 For cavity flows, the spanwise wave number was approximately one cavity
 depth as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2009"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Complementing their suggestions, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

literal "false"

\end_inset

 also demonstrated the spanwise steady modes in curved free shear layers.
 Although such a step height or cavity depth is difficult to define in the
 slat cove case, the slat chord 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}=0.039m$
\end_inset

 can be taken for an equivalent diameter for a circumcircle that passes
 through both the slat cusp and the trailing edge.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}$
\end_inset

 can be taken for an equivalent cavity depth.
 For the standard case we showed that the non-dimensional wave number using
 the same for spanwise modulation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{z}=\frac{\lambda_{z}}{C_{s}}$
\end_inset

, would then range between 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

 cells to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.7$
\end_inset

 for 3 cells, or zero when no cells are formed.

Consequently, and following Barkley, Bres and Liou, the spanwise modulation
 in slat cove is also reasoned to be primarily influenced by initial shear
 layer curvature with the exact value determined by the snapping necessitated
 by spanwise extend of the simulation.
 The snapping occurs since although the periodic condition represents an
 infinite spatial domain for the flow, it ensures that all variables have
 identical values on both spanwise edges at all time steps.
 This means that any standing wave pattern along spanwise direction will
 have to select a wave number such that the flow is congruent between the
 domain ends.
 The wave number is thus selected as the nearest whole number that fits
 the span length.
 For our simulations, the spanwise wavelength is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2\,m$
\end_inset

 and as the slat position is varied, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open
\begin_layout Plain Layout
\backslash textcolor{red}{the degree}
\end_layout
\end_inset
 of centrifugal modes
 are first driven by the curvature of the shear layer and then the periodic
 condition leads to selection of the nearest possible whole number.
 Note that the same effect occurs in the presence of walls where the Dirichlet
 condition in pressure and velocity causes the spanwise wave number to snap
 to whole numbers.

These spanwise velocity cells for all cases are given in the Appendix B.
 Among them the Cases 
\begin_inset Formula $[4,11,12,18,\text{ and }19]$
\end_inset

 have no cells corresponding to a null wave number.
 On comparing their shear layer curvatures from Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spanwise_cookies"

\end_inset

, it can be noted that these cases have shear layers which have a low curvature
 on the early region near the cusp.
 Case 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 is a clear anomaly where the slat overlap causes a delayed curvature with
 the initial shear layer parallel to the outer wall of slat cusp.
 For Case 
\begin_inset Formula $11$
\end_inset

, the case develops a weak spanwise homogeneous flow however not forming
 cells due to the fact that the initial curvature is low, and with a significant
ly low exit velocity.
 The reduced exit velocity reduces both the streamline velocity along the
 shear layer and the recirculation velocity, and hence reduces the growth
 of centrifugal related instabilities.
 The same follows for Case 
\begin_inset Formula $18$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $19$
\end_inset

 where the shear layers are initially parallel to the incoming flow and
 the curvature increases in the mid-trajectory to compensate the delay and
 redirect the flow.
 Thus, in comparison with Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

, whose wave length is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{z}=1.7$
\end_inset

, the above-mentioned cases have a lower initial curvature.
 This suggest two things: one is that it is additional proof that the spanwise
 modes are driven by the curvature of the shear layer since the wave number
 varies proportional to the initial curvature.
 The second is that unlike for the vorticity conversion, only the early
 part of the shear layer is significant as a driver of the mode formation.
 This could be possibly due to the fact that the initial shear layer curvature
 determines the radial of the recirculation bubble which ultimately determines
 the strength of centrifugal effects.

Investigating this proposition further, Cases

 have the smallest wavelength of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{z}=1.025$
\end_inset

.
 Comparing the shear layer profiles from Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spanwise_cookies-2"

\end_inset

, these cases clearly have its initial curvatures as highest in the dataset
 and also an impingement point farthest from the trailing edge due to a
 high slat overlap.
 Thus the reduced diameter of the recirculation cavity explains the decrease
 in the spanwise cell size.
 These cases can also be noted to have a low broadband and tonal characteristic
 noise (See Appendix B for spectra) and owes to the early impingement leading
 to a complete decoherence of the ejected vorticity at trailing edge.

\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This can be explained based on the curvature instability leading to a complete
 transfer of vorticity to streamwise structures prior to their crossing
 the trailing edge.
 Nevertheless, the generation of a high wave number spanwise mode will also
 generate more number of diverging planes.
 The divergent planes periodically disrupt the spanwise vorticity of the
 shed vortices which are responsible for the aeroacoustic resonance.
 Hence this factor also acts in tandem to reduce the noise efficiency of
 this configuration and contributes to a high turbulence with majorly streamwise
 oriented vorticity being ejected from the slat gap.
 
\color brown
Although not elaborated in our work, these cases can also be seen to have
 a high level of high frequency noise above 
\begin_inset Formula $10 kHzkHz$
\end_inset

 suggesting that this component is sourced by the high speed ejection of
 streamwise structures onto the suction side of the main element.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast, as can be noted from Cases 
\begin_inset Formula $[10,15,17,20,21,22,24]$
\end_inset

 (see Appendix B), whose wavelength 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{z}=1.7$
\end_inset

, these arrangements produce the most noisy cases.
 Hence the presence of modes does not directly imply that the characteristic
 noise sources including the aeroacoustic resonance are significantly disrupted
 solely by presence of these modes.
 Rather, they induce additional dynamics arising from their periodicity.
 In Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:04_The_VALIANT_Case"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we showed that for the standard positioning of the slat, there exists
 a low frequency 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bursting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the divergent planes at frequency corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $St=0.156$
\end_inset

.
 This oscillation modulates the spanwise coherence of the shear layer such
 that the aeroacoustic loop is not driven by a steady shedding and impingement
 of spanwise coherent vortices but with an intermittent modulation of the
 coherence length of the impinging turbulence.
 We proposed that the resulting tones hence will also be amplitude modulated
 thereby developing side bands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate the spanwise mode oscillations further, we now extract the
 spanwise distribution of the velocity spectra for the modulated spanwise
 component.
 As shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spanwise_psd_probe17_1"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spanwise_psd_probe17_2"

\end_inset

, the power spectra of spanwise velocity component has a localized spike
 around 
\begin_inset Formula $200\,Hz$
\end_inset

 corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $St=0.156$
\end_inset

 for all the cases studied.
 A particular statement can be that for the Case 15 in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spanwise_psd_probe17_1"

\end_inset

.
 Here it can be observed that the case have three wavelengths within the
 spanwise domain.
 Hence, for the region near the slat trailing edge, there are 3 diverging
 planes and 3 converging planes.
 For the figure, the power spectral densities of velocity is obtained for
 a reduced spanwise length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1\,m$
\end_inset

 and hence the 2 diverging planes close to the mid-plane are captured.
 Also note that for positioning of the diverging cells, the lower and upper
 array of cells in the slat cove have a shifted phase by a quarter of wavelength.
 These spikes can be noticed to occur at the locations of the diverging
 planes where the spanwise velocity is zero and increasing.
 These spanwise localization is also present in all cases that have the
 cell formation and can be deduced from the exhaustive dataset presented
 in Appendix B.

In contrast, for cases which does not have a spanwise modulation of the
 velocity due to its low insufficient initial curvature, the oscillation
 is still present but not localized along the span, i.e.
 the oscillation is homogeneous.
 This is demonstrated in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The low frequency range of the spectra also shows saturation of the standard
 color map below 
\begin_inset Formula $200\,Hz$

 suggesting high amplitude of oscillation compared to the cases where they
 are absent.
 On examining one of these cases further using a better color map, the particula

 structure at a very high wave number than the rest of the cases and a low
 amplitude variation of the spanwise velocity across the span, typically
 less than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1U_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be attributed to the recirculation of the streamwise structures
 which are periodically generated at the impingement and convected back
 to the early shear layer region by the recirculation.
 These cases are thus not forming the larger scale spanwise cells that are
 present in other cases but is only a spanwise homogeneous oscillation correspon

 The spanwise velocity component obtained shows that there exists a pertinent
 fluctuation around a zero mean flow component corresponding to the frequency
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $130Hz$
\end_inset

 suggesting that the flow near the cusp tends to oscillate with a homogeneous
 phase along the full span.
 This oscillation hence, more probable than not, be a fundamental instability
 mode related to the centrifugal effects.
 As mentioned, for a spanwise periodic simulation without explicit constraint
 at the boundary, the curvature determines the wave-number.
 Accordingly, for the case with severely low initial curvature due to the
 positioning of the slat, the spanwise mode number is close to 1 or less,
 leading to a spanwise homogeneous oscillation at the same Strouhal number
 range.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The low frequency fluctuations present in both cases with and without the
 spanwise modes suggest that this frequency itself is not directly connected
 to the centrifugal instability but rather a feature of a different flow
 dynamics.
 To investigate this, we choose an arbitrary position inside the cove, in
 close proximity to the slat cusp, where if a streamline is sourced would
 generate one that enters the recirculation after the impingement location.
 The three dimensional length of this streamline is then used to obtain
 the velocity profile, the time of travel along which can be used to obtain
 the recirculation frequency.
 The recirculation frequency as a function of the streamline path length
 for Cases 
\begin_inset Formula $[5,11,22,\text{ and }29]$
\end_inset

 are shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:recirculation_frequency_case29"

\end_inset

.
 The recirculation frequencies for these cases show that the time taken
 for a streamline particle from the vicinity of the slat cusp to return
 to the same vicinity via the recirculation explains the oscillation at
 
\begin_inset Formula $200\,Hz$
\end_inset

.
 This is true in the case of the three dimensional recirculation where the
 streamline is not necessarily two dimensional and the spanwise velocity
 leads to spanwise drifting.
 The frequency finds a better matching when the spanwise modes are formed
 as in the case of Case 
\begin_inset Formula $22$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $29$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
For Case 
\begin_inset Formula $11$
\end_inset

 where the shear layer has a low initial curvature, the oscillation is spanwise
 homogeneous with a frequency slightly lower than the recirculation.
 Precisely, in this case, the frequency of spanwise oscillation is 
\begin_inset Formula $100\,Hz$
\end_inset

 and the recirculation frequency is at 
\begin_inset Formula $170\,Hz$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the ratio of spanwise homogeneous oscillation frequency to that of recirculatio
n is at approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $0.6$
\end_inset

.
 We do not put forward an explanation for this but only suggest that it
 can be possibly due to the presence of a spanwise homogeneous drift velocity
 present in this case causing the recirculation loop to be a spiral with
 axis along the span, as seen in the streamline visualization in Fig.

.
 In contrast, for the other cases with presence of spanwise modes, the modes
 constrain the spanwise velocity to have opposing polarity with the cells
 and the oscillations to occur at the diverging planes.
 Then at this frequency, the diverging spanwise velocity leads to a saturation
 of the low pressure thereby bursting the shear layer at the recirculation
 frequency.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this last chapter, we utilized the LBM based ProLB solver and high-fidelity
 data generated using same to investigate the slat cove dynamics.
 We parameterized the slat positioning with respect to the main element
 using a three variable coordinate and used a surrogate model based automated
 exploration using Bayesian Active Learning to collect the dataset such
 that maximum information pertaining to the variation of the spectra is
 captured.
 The flow recordings were then investigated to uncover the slat cove dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On inspecting the dataset, it was first showed that the spectra showed strong
 sensitivity to the shape of the shear layer as expected.
 Following the theory of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Terracol2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that the tone frequencies are selected by the Rossiter mechanism, we investigat
ed the effect of shear layer shape in determining the strength of the resonance.
 For this we followed the suggestion of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that a curved free shear layer has instabilities related to the centrifugal
 forces and can develop steady spanwise modes as well as Görtler like vortices.
 Based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Bradshaw1969"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we characterized the slat shear layer for each case using its distribution
 of curvature and Richardson number.
 It was shown that the Richardson number for all cases are well in the unstable
 regime near the slat trailing edge.
 Nevertheless, the variation of Richardson number and corresponding variation
 in the spanwise coherence near the trailing edge is less significant than
 what would be caused by the effect of the position of the impingement location.
 The movement of the impingement location to the closest to the trailing
 edge is hence a better predictor for the strength of the tones.
 It happens geometrically that it is only possible to produce an additional
 curvature near the trailing edge by inadvertently making the impingement
 point to move upstream.
 The decoherence effect by the impingement then trumps the effect of additional
 curvatures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second and novel finding related to the cove dynamics was presented in
 Chapter 04, i.e.
 the presence of spanwise modulated spanwise velocity.
 We showed using the dataset that the slat chord normalized wavelength of
 these modes 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{z}=\frac{\lambda_{z}}{C_{s}}$
\end_inset

 ranges between 
\begin_inset Formula $1.0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.7$
\end_inset

, the exact value dictated by the spanwise length of the cove.
 We also demonstrated using the curvature distribution of shear layers that
 a high initial curvature is the characteristic that leads to a stronger
 modulation leading to smaller wavelength of the spanwise velocity.
 Further investigation of the spanwise distribution of velocity spectra
 then revealed that there exist spanwise localized oscillations at 
\begin_inset Formula $200\,Hz$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The investigation of this spanwise distribution for all cases in the dataset
 showed that oscillation is present in all cases which develops the spanwise
 modes, and the localization is always in the diverging planes.
 The oscillations were also found to be always within the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $200\,Hz$
\end_inset

 for all cases in the dataset.
 In search of the source of this frequency, the three dimensional recirculating
 streamlines were generated and the recirculation times were then shown
 to fall in the same range around 
\begin_inset Formula $200\,Hz$
\end_inset

.
 Hence it is theorized that the low frequency oscillation is the effect
 of the periodic recirculation, often referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pulsation of the cove
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in recent literature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the low frequency oscillations were also visualized in the previous
 chapter using the Q-criterion demonstrating that this phenomena is a periodic
 bursting of the shed spanwise vorticity at the slat cusp.
 The spanwise coherence of the spanwise vorticity is hence periodically
 disrupted at its initial shedding phase leading to generation of small
 scale streamwise vortices.
 Being generated in diverging planes, these small scale structure is then
 convected by either positive or negative spanwise velocity.
 Being a turbulent process, the effect of this bursting and breaking of
 spanwise coherence is thus intractable periodically at the region farther
 from the cusp region.
 This very well explain the mode switching behavior that is attributed to
 the variation of coherence length and dominant tonal fluctuations across
 the spanwise extend reported in very recent literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wei2025"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This also explains the apparent stochasticity of the slat tones reported
 in the experimental investigations of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KamliyaJawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Here it must be emphasized that the experimental investigations which selects
 the spanwise mid-plane to place the wall pressure and hot-wire probes may
 or may not be at the center of a diverging plane depending of the development
 of the cells.
 Hence, the studied characteristics will inevitably tend to diverge between
 the experimental observations from different wind tunnel cases in view
 of periodicity.
 The turbulence ejection that accompanies the bursting phenomena will also
 appear to induce intermittency in the turbulence characteristics in the
 slat gap since the periodicity of bursting is robust only in the very early
 shear layer near the slat cusp and the generated vorticity from each event
 is then convected along with the rest of turbulence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the fact that the bursting occurs at the diverging planes due to saturatio
n of a suction pressure at diverging planes is not entirely consistent with
 the fact that its frequency is close to the recirculation frequency.
 The saturation of low pressure could have been synchronized with other
 modes which are more probable, for example with the first Rossiter mode,
 and the flow recirculation frequency is an unintuitive candidate to synchronize
 with the spanwise mode oscillation, thereby suggesting a non-trivial coupling
 between the bursting phenomena and the recirculation.
 This aspect hence is an intriguing line of experimentation for future investiga
tions.
 Nevertheless, with the current understanding from our dataset and the presented
 results herein, it is overwhelmingly evident that the low frequency oscillation
 associated with the recirculation phenomena is pertinent to the establishment
 of characteristic noise sources in the cove dynamics.

The idea of a low frequency modulation of the Rossiter tone by periodic
 disruption of the spanwise coherence of the shear layer and its periodic
 busting leading to generation of a streamwise vorticity is essential to
 form the complete picture of the slat cove dynamics that was until today
 characterized in terms of the 2D Rossiter mechanism.
 The low frequency modulation leading to generation of periodic and localized
 generation of streamwise vorticity also explains the intermittency characterist
ics that was so far speculated from the turbulence characteristics at the
 slat trailing edge.
 Clearly, the generation of streamwise structures at the early shear layer
 at locations of diverging planes are then convected by an in-homogeneous
 spanwise velocity through a fully turbulent shear layer with interactions
 between the recirculated small scale turbulence and additional turbulence
 generated due to the centrifugal convective instability.
 This renders the turbulence characteristic at the trailing edge to lose
 pertinent information about the coherent periodicity occurring at the early
 shear layer.
 This factor explains why the spanwise behavior and bursting remained elusive
 thus far from the previous investigators whose methodology primarily focused
 on data collected at the mid-span plane and the unsteady fluctuations at
 the slat trailing edge.

Slat cove vortices and their behavior is an intriguing phenomenon in view
 of their dynamics.
 As well-explained in the literature for slat noise, the primary vortices
 in the cove are those generated from the slat cusp due to the shearing
 of flow between inner cove flow and the incoming ambient.
 The velocity difference leads to 2D Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability and
 leads to formation of structures which are nearly homogeneous in the spanwise
 direction.
 The vortices then travel to the slat trailing edge as they are convected
 by the mean flow which itself is accelerated by its passage through the
 constricted slat gap.
 The resulting acceleration leads to breaking up of the spanwise coherent
 structures into streamwise structures as they travel past the slat trailing
 edge and thus the ejected flow majorly contain streamwise oriented counter
 rotating vortex strands.
 These strands then interact with each other to generate helical vortices
 as they are are flushed onto the suction side of the airfoil.
 A visualization by isolating the spanwise coherent vortices shed from the
 slat cusp and their transition behavior towards the trailing edge is shown
 in Fig.

The behavior of cove vortices are hence interesting from a view of its fundament
al fluid mechanics.
 One interesting phenomena is the above-said transition of majorly spanwise
 vorticity in the early shear layer into streamwise vortices.
 One theory suggesting the generation of streamwise vortices is derived
 from an analogy related to Görtler vortices.
 In boundary layer flow past a concavely curved wall, the flow tends to
 develop streamwise oriented vortices as studied in detail by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and later by

.
 According to their analysis, the centrifugal force developed due to the
 curvature of the streamline is balanced by a pressure gradient normal to
 the streamline.
 The pressure gradient is responsible for redirecting the flow along the
 curved path and at higher curvatures when the centrifugal force is in excess,
 the pressure gradient developed will not be sufficient to redirect the
 flow resulting in an instability.
 In the unstable regime, the flow try to balance itself by generation of
 streamwise vorticity that aid in the transfer of momentum across this pressure
 gradient normal to the streamline.
 Moreover, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:gortler_vortices_schematic"
plural "false"

\end_inset

, the angular velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $rU$
\end_inset

 is 0 at both the center of curvature and at the wall since 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

 at the center of curvature and 
\begin_inset Formula $U=0$
\end_inset

 at the wall respectively.
 Hence there must exist a maxima for the angular velocity in the flow region
 and also a region where 
\begin_inset Formula $rU<0$
\end_inset

.
 This idea was used by Görtler to show that the solutions to corresponding
 disturbance equations are of the form of streamwise-oriented counter rotating
 vortices.

 the curvature needs to be concave and satisfy the Rayleigh criteria

\end_inset

.
 In the trajectory of slat cove vortices, this transition is thus justified
 only near the trailing edge, where the flow is redirected away from the
 impingement location to be ejected out of the slat cove.
 At this location, the streamline curvature is such that high speed flow
 is on its concave side thus having a negative velocity gradient along the
 radius of curvature.
 Let aside the fact that the flow is strongly accelerated at the slat gap
 due to the nozzle effect of the cove geometry, the curvature effect is
 sufficient to generate streamwise vorticity.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 experimentally studied the effect of chord based Reynolds number on the
 cove vortex dynamics and suggested that the Görtler vortices are present
 even at low Reynolds numbers, 
\begin_inset Formula $Re\approx1.3\times10^{4}$
\end_inset

 when shedding of spanwise coherent vortices from the cusp are absent.
 At higher Reynolds numbers, the flow develops the spanwise coherent structures
 in the early shear layer and is convected through the region of unstable
 curvature near the trailing edge.
 These spanwise structures thus interacts with the streamwise vortices that
 are generated in-situ and also those which are convected from the recirculation.
 In this interaction, the spanwise vorticity is again readily converted
 into streamwise vorticity resulting in a saturation of streamwise vortices
 in the trailing edge.

\begin_inset Formula $0.01m$
\end_inset

, this translates to a sufficient condition that the shear layer is susceptible
 to curvature effects if the shear layer thickness is more than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01/300=3\times10^{-5}m$
\end_inset

.
 From the mean velocity profile for the flow around the cusp, the shear
 layer thickness near the shedding region is roughly 0.002m as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, which is about 60 times the requirement for the instability.
 Hence, the cove shear layer is clearly in the unstable regime related to
 curvature instabilities.
 In addition, any assumptions of linearity of the resulting interactions
 may be too exacting as well.
 According to the analysis of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Liou2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the curvature Richardson numbers that allow linearity are of the order
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 In the cove shear layer, the curvature Richardson number is near saturation
 at a value of 2, and hence suggest a strongly non-linear regime.

Spanwise cell formation for spanwise velocity and vorticity

A second phenomenon pertinent to the cove flow dynamics is the appearance
 of spanwise modulation.
 The mean velocity and pressure fields develop spanwise cells when the flow
 is fully developed, with the spanwise modulation best recognizable in the
 spanwise component of velocity.
 Alternating directions of spanwise velocity can be noted, as shown in Figure

, with wave numbers varying consistently with nature of cove vortex shape.
 The strongest fluctuations associated with these cells appears to be attached
 to the cove flow shear layer, and is present dominantly inside the cove
 region.
 The flow is also modulated on the concave side of the flow curvature at
 slat gap.

Most recent findings of spanwise modulated behavior in cavity flows that
 are relevant to cove dynamics is the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"

\end_inset

, which were inspired by an earlier work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Faure2007"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 They characterized the flow in open cavities at a moderate Reynolds number
 range less than 
\begin_inset Formula $1.1\times10^{4}$
\end_inset

 to demonstrate that spanwise modulations of similar nature occurs in open
 cavity flows.
 They characterized such behavior as a result of local curvature of the
 flow.
 When the flow recirculates around the closed walls inside the cavity, the
 streamlines are curved along with a no-slip conditioning at the walls.
 Such curvature is hence subject to the curvature led instability and satisfy
 the Rayleigh criteria that the angular momentum decreases with respect
 the radial direction of streamline curvature.
 Note that this phenomena is now consistent with the fact that cove flow
 aeroacoustics are closely related to open cavity flows in that the aeroacoustic
 resonance mechanism driven by the cove shear layer is understood in close
 analogy to the well-known Rossiter mechanism for cavity resonance.
 This identification of spanwise modulated behavior of the flow is a new
 contribution to the slat noise literature in this thesis and hence we try
 to document the same as much as possible using the data obtained using
 the simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Let us first look at the case of a standard slat position with respect to
 the main element.
 A visualization of the spanwise cells of spanwise velocity in the slat
 cove is shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CoveSpanwiseModulationGriffonStandardCase"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 For the case of inflow velocity of 50 m/s, the chord based Reynolds number
 of the flow is roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{6}$
\end_inset

, 2 orders of magnitude higher than 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bres2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

's moderate Reynolds numbers studied for open cavity flows.
 Also as mentioned in the previous subsection, the curvature Richardson
 number for this case is significantly higher than regimes considered for
 study of linear growth rate of the curvature instability.
 Hence this spanwise modulation is suggested as a result of saturation of
 possibly non-linear instability arising from the centrifugal effects in
 the cove recirculation.
 The initial curvature of the shear layer can be noted to be a good indicator
 of the strength of curvature effects.
 In Case 22, the shear layer radius of curvature is 0.025m, same order of
 magnitude as the slat chord, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{s}\approx0.039m$
\end_inset

.
 This results in a curvature Richardson number of 1.1 in the early shear
 layer.
 The resulting shape of the cove recirculation region is shown in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:CovebubbleCase22"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 As can be noted in comparison with other cases, the curvature Richardson
 number of Case 22 is moderate between the range of 0.2 and 1.6 for other
 cases.
 This case develops a spanwise wavenumber of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{z}=0.2/3=0.067m$
\end_inset

, with three wavelengths fit to the spanwise domain length of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2m$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The pressure field inside the recirculation bubble is also interesting in
 that there does not exit a spanwise uniform low pressure core for the recircula
tion bubble.
 The mean pressure distribution is instead forming cells which are curved
 in their ends towards the shear layer and leads to formation of nodal planes
 towards which the flow converges and diverges.
 Such planes convect the low wavenumber Görtler vortices that are recirculating
 in the slat cove and leads to their concentration in these planes where
 the flow converges.
 From the comparison of the pressure and velocity fields, it appears also
 that the convergent planes tend to have the center of recirculation deeper
 into the cove whereas as for divergent planes, where the flow convect fluid
 away from the plane, the center of recirculation is closer to the shear
 layer.
 This means that spanwise flow velocity is driven by establishment of mean
 pressure distribution developed as a result of the centrifugal effect.
 On the contrary, if the nodal planes developed a higher pressure distribution,
 it could have been reasoned as s stagnation effect that converging fluid
 mass drives the pressure field modulation, but however this is not the
 case.
 The centrifugal effect of the shear layer flow generates radially outward
 flow which elicit a response from the flow pressure distribution to have
 a low pressure inner region at the center of the bubble.
 However, this behavior is not stable in the spanwise direction and hence
 a homogeneous low pressure center of circulation is not absent, and instead
 a wavy pattern is formed resulting in the convergent and divergent planes
 where the fluid mass is redistributed accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem*

\series bold
Why does the fluid want to form spanwise modulations instead of a spanwise
 homogeneous cove flow where the centrifugal effect is balanced by the radial
 pressure gradient?

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a fundamental question about the Navier-Stokes behavior.
 The conservation of momentum of fluid in rotating configuration is famously
 unstable to perturbations along the axis of rotation.
 The Taylor-Couette configuration of flow between two rotating cylinders
 is a classical example where, if the Rayleigh criterion is satisfied, and
 if the flow is within the unstable range of Taylor numbers, the flow develops
 axisymmetric tubes of rotating fluids stacked along the axis of rotation.
 At higher Taylor numbers, which denotes the ratio of the centrifugal force
 to the viscous forces in a fluid, the flow also tends to develop spiral
 wavy patterns.
 The complexity of this configuration and the richness of this problem is
 evident from the variety of regimes for a Taylor-Couette system as described
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 They characterized a system of concentric cylinders based on the inner
 and outer-cylinder Reynolds numbers, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{o}$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting 2-dimensional domain produces Taylor vortices, wavy vortices,
 modulated wavy vortices, and spiral vortices to mention a few, and are
 reproduced from their original work in Figure

For the slat cove flow behavior, we believe that the most relevant region
 is that of co-rotating cylinders.
 This is because the inner and outer flow in the slat cove have the same
 sense of rotation but different speeds.
 Hence it must be possible to identify the slat cove flow behavior in terms
 of an equivalent inner and outer flow Reynolds number.
 In comparison with the Taylor-Couette flows, in can be noticed in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 that TC flow tends to have an asymptotic behavior towards Azimuthally laminar
 flow with weak Ekman vortices (AZI).
 Hence it is convincingly possible that effect of cove recirculation and
 centrifugal forces are responsible for the formation of the spanwise modulation
s in slat cove.
 However, this notice of spanwise modulation was not the primary motive
 of our study and hence we do not engage a fundamental analysis of this
 phenomenon.
 Nevertheless we intend to convince the reader of its significance and that
 it is not possible to have a complete understanding of slat cove flow without
 characterizing this aspect.

That being said, we now proceed to investigate the dataset.
 Variation of slat position with respect to the main element provides a
 way to compare the effect of cove recirculation on the formation of the
 modes.
 For this we choose to compare cases which have a sufficient variety of
 the slat shear layer shape.
 We choose Case 22 as a reference case as this is the most noisy case available
 in the dataset and also having the farfield noise spectra closest to experiment
al case.
 For comparison, three other cases are chosen, which are Cases 5, 29, and
 11, from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:allcases"
plural "false"
caps "false"

 and are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For Case 5, the slat position is move closer to the main element by reducing
 the slat overlap.
 This has resulted in a configuration where the slat trailing edge is positioned
 downstream of the main element leading edge, however still with a sufficient
 slat gap for avoiding choking of the ejected flow.
 This case hence maintains a high velocity profile along the mean shear
 layer while moving the impingement location deeper into the cove away from
 the slat trailing edge.
 For the initial region of the shear layer, this means that initial radius
 of curvature is reduced while maintaining a sufficiently high flow velocity.
 Hence this case is expected to display and amplified effect of the shear
 layer curvature effect.
 Accordingly it can be noted that the case develops 10 spanwise cells, with
 a corresponding spanwise wavenumber 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{z}=\frac{N_{z}}{L_{z}}=\frac{5}{0.2}=25$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the spanwise wavenumber quantitatively can be sensitive to the
 spanwise extend of the domain since the periodic condition influence the
 wavenumber selection mechanism by provide a hard boundary condition of
 the length of the domain.
 However, given that all our simulations are conducted using the same spanwise
 extend, the wavenumber of the cells remains a useful representation for
 comparing the cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For Case 22 and 29, the resulting spanwise wavelength is 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{z}=15\text{ and }20$
\end_inset

.
 The curvature Richardson number on the initial shear layer as seen in Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Curvature-Richardson-Number"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is at 1.2.
 Hence this case can be reasoned to be on the interface between the stability
 modes of the spanwise instability, leading to a shift of the selected wavenumbe
r.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For Case 11, the slat positioning is such that the trailing edge is again
 close to the main element however with a much smaller slat gap than Case
 5, leading to a choking of the flow.
 Hence the flow velocity is smaller along the shear, in agreement with the
 larger cove flow and also with a lower curvature of the initial shear layer.
 Hence this case is an example of the case with significantly smaller effect
 of the centrifugal forces on the flow.
 As can be noted, this case does not form spanwise modulations in the mean
 flow.

Effect of cove recirculation on the slat noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\align left
The spanwise coherence of these vortices is a crucial factor that affect
 their aeroacoustics.
 The efficiency of impinging vortices to drive the acoustic mechanism –
 which generate an acoustic wave that travel back to the slat cusp to excite
 the aeroacoustic resonance – depends on the spanwise coherence of the structure.
 If the impinging structure is spanwise homogeneous, it will lead to generation
 of acoustic waves which are also nearly spanwise homogeneous leading to
 a two dimensional resonance loop.
 This in theory must be related to the strength of tonal peaks in the far-field
 acoustic spectra and hence arises the importance of phenomena responsible
 for the transfer of vorticity from spanwise to streamwise direction.
 Moreover, it is possible that the acoustic wave generation mechanism responsibl
e for the resonance loop is not directly due to the impingement of the vortices
 but due to the scattering of the incident pressure field the eddies by
 the trailing edge.
 As shown in Figure

\end_inset

, a spanwise oriented eddy while passing by the trailing edge causes an
 abrupt change of the incident pressure at the trailing edge.
 The variation is coherent in the spanwise direction and lead to generation
 of an amplified dipole sound source.
 On the contrary, in the case of a streamwise oriented eddy convected past
 a sharp trailing edge, the temporal variation of pressure distribution
 at the trailing edge is not significant and such eddies does not generate
 a strong noise source.
 Hence naturally, the composition of turbulence that flow past the trailing
 edge has to be spanwise coherent with a lower proportion of streamwise
 structure for the case to have strong tonal components.

Simulations with half spanwise extends
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A simulation with half the spanwise length was also executed to probe the
 existence of spanwise modulations when the spanwise extend is varied.
 All simulation parameters were kept identical and only the spanwise extend
 was reduced to half, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1m$
\end_inset

.
 As shown in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:spanwise_modes"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the new spanwise extend also allows the formation of spanwise velocity
 cells with the diverging and converging planes.
 These cells however not does not maintain the same wavelength as in the
 original case.
 Since there are two full cells in a spanwise extend of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1m$
\end_inset

, the wavelength can be approximated as 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05m$
\end_inset

.
 However in the standard positioning of the slat, there are three cells
 over a spanwise extend of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2m$
\end_inset

 thereby giving the wavelength as 
\begin_inset Formula $0.066m$
\end_inset

.
 This variation is in agreement with the fact that the spanwise boundary
 conditions impose a strong condition of congruence on the spanwise boundaries
 leading to restriction on the wave number selection.
 However the presence of modes can be inferred to be independent of the
 spanwise extend of the simulation.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Apart from the dynamics of the flow, implications of spanwise modes on acoustics
 arise not from the spatial modes themselves but from the above mentioned
 periodic bursting.
 The spanwise coherence of impinging vortex is the first necessary condition
 for aeroacoustic resonance to occur since the Rossiter mechanism is a largely
 2D phenomenon with the strength of resonance decreasing progressively with
 spanwise coherence
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "HamiltonSmith2024,Souza2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Hence, if the spanwise coherence is broken periodically at a frequency
 lower than the first Rossiter tone, the strength of resonance will also
 be modulated, which means that the acoustic tones are not sourced by ideally
 periodic fluctuations but are amplitude modulated by the bursting frequency.
 Such an amplitude modulation can be detected in the spectral domain as
 appearance of side bands which we conjectured as the reason for the first
 Rossiter tone to appear broadband due to contributions from side band frequenci
es.
 This is however observable only if the span to chord ratio of the simulation
 is sufficiently large such that the centrifugally driven spanwise mode
 oscillations are prominent, as in the case of experiment by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KamliyaJawahar2021"

\end_inset

.
 The same effect will also vitiate the periodicity of the noise source character
istics rendering them as intermittent or quasi-periodic if analyzed close
 to the diverging planes.
 This is promptly underlined in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 which shed light on the intermittency associated with the first Rossiter
 tone.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In summary, the effect of shear layer shape on acoustics is qualitatively
 deducible from the collection of cases.
 It can be noted that both broadband and tonal noise levels are dependent
 primarily on the exit velocity with additional influence from the location
 of impingement and shear layer shape.
 This complements the literature where a scaling law of the slat noise level
 was established with OASPL in the characteristic frequency range proportional
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{5}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the free stream Mach number
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Roger2005,Santana,Singer2000,Takeda2004,Guo2012"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, the location of impingement does not necessarily need to be stationary
 with an increase in the free-stream velocity and neither does the maximum
 exit velocity since the impingement location can influence both the recirculati
on flow rate and the exit flow rate.
 This determines the the velocity with which coherent structures are ejected
 past the trailing edge.
 Adding to the same complexity, the shear layer shape variation introduce
 varying levels of centrifugal instability to the shear layer which determine
 the vorticity transitions from spanwise coherent structures to streamwise
 which determine the efficiency of the TE scattering leading to broadband
 noise.
 This explains why the canonical scaling laws based on free-stream parameters
 alone have high uncertainties for standard slat-noise prediction models
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Guo2003,Bolivar2020"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally, the location of impingement being close to the trailing edge
 is a strong indicator of the presence of characteristic noise signature
 regardless of the shear layer shape.
 Hence, it can be safely assumed that the the far-field power levels of
 the characteristic noise is primarily determined by the strength of dynamics
 at the trailing edge.
 Given these factors, we consider that an appropriate analysis of the slat
 noise characteristics and scaling laws must be based on the geometric parameter
s of the shear layer rather than based on the geometric positional variables
 of the slat or free stream parameters.
 The former can have a non-linear relation with the shape parameters of
 the shear layer and can hence introduce unpredictability if the noise levels
 are modelled in terms of the former only.

\begin_layout Chapter
Conclusions and Future Perspectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research presented in this thesis attempts to advance the understanding
 of leading-edge slat noise through high-fidelity simulation, detailed flow
 analysis, and innovative surrogate modeling.
 The main findings from each chapter can be summarized as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Literature Review – Aeroacoustic Noise Mechanisms and Slat Noise:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The survey of past studies highlighted the canonical aeroacoustic mechanisms
 with the objective to explain the leading-edge slat noise.
 One striking feature of slat noise research is that there exists a discrepancy
 between the experiment and flight test for the tonal nature of its noise.
 The tones are not acknowledged to exist in the flight test data but are
 a prominent feature in subscale noise testing from early on.
 Also despite extensive experimental efforts and analytical models, the
 complex cove flow dynamics of slats remained only partially understood,
 with phenomena like intermittent behavior of the aeroacoustic tones reported
 but not fully explained.
 This motivated the use of advanced computational approaches.
 The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) emerged as a promising tool for aeroacoustic
 simulation of such flows, offering inherently low dissipation and excellent
 parallel scalability for capturing acoustic waves.
 The literature review thus established both the need for high-fidelity
 analysis of slat noise mechanisms to investigate it in light of known aeroacous
tic mechanisms and the potential of LBM to meet this need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Simulation Framework – LBM validation for Aeroacoustics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A comprehensive study of the theoretical underpinning of LBM and a validation
 of the LBM solver 
\begin_inset Formula $\emph{ProLB}$
\end_inset

 was carried out for a standard slat configuration in free-stream conditions.
 The solver was able to reproduce the mean flow field and surface pressure
 distribution on the slat-main element configuration with good accuracy
 when compared to experimental data.
 In particular, the simulated wall-pressure coefficients on the slat and
 main element showed the correct trends and magnitude, with minor discrepancies
 attributable to differences of experimental setup from that of simulation.
 The far-field sound predictions using a Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FWH)
 acoustic analogy also demonstrated a close agreement across the frequency
 range of interest, confirming that the LBM-FWH approach can capture both
 broadband and tonal noise components of the slat.
 This validation aided to establish confidence in the numerical framework’s
 capability for high-fidelity aeroacoustic simulation of slat noise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Flow Physics of the Slat Cove:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the validated solver, an in-depth analysis of the baseline (standard)
 slat geometry was performed to investigate the noise-generation mechanisms.
 The study revealed the details of a highly complex unsteady flow in the
 slat cove region characterized by spanwise-periodic cellular structures
 in the recirculation bubble.
 These spanwise cells – alternating converging and diverging flow regions
 along the span – are driven by a centrifugal instability of the curved
 shear layer in the cove.
 As the shear layer rolls over the slat cusp, it forms spanwise coherent
 vortices that initially organize according to the cellular pressure pattern.
 During this thesis we have uncovered a previously unknown localised and
 periodic “bursting” phenomenon at a characteristic non-dimensional frequency
 around St ≈ 0.16 (based on slat chord and freestream velocity) which corresponds
 to the recirculation frequency of the slat cove.
 The spanwise coherent vortical structures shed from the cusp also abruptly
 breaks down into smaller-scale streamwise vortices.
 This bursting occurs preferentially at the diverging planes of the spanwise
 cells (where a pressure deficit accumulates) and convects downstream with
 the shear layer.
 The result is a recurrent injection of turbulence into the shear layer.
 These findings expand on the current understanding of slat cove dynamics
 by pinpointing a specific mechanism for the transition from large coherent
 structures to fine-scale turbulence via an intrinsic unsteady mode of the
 recirculation flow.
 Notably, the estimated frequency of the cove “pulsation” matches the low-freque
ncy tone observed in slat noise spectra, suggesting a direct link between
 the unsteady recirculation and acoustic emissions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Slat Noise Generation Mechanisms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flow features thus understood translated into clear noise-generation
 pathways.
 The shear layer emanating from the slat cusp impinges on the slat trailing
 edge, and its unsteadiness induces pressure fluctuations.
 These fluctuations can emanate themselves as farfield noise but also interact
 with the vortex shedding at the slat cusp to cause an aeroacoustic resonance.
 The resonant modes act as sources of tonal noise.
 The intermittent breakdown of spanwise coherence in the shear layer explains
 the tone intermittency and mode switching reported in experiments for slat
 noise – essentially, the effective coherence length of the noise sources
 in the gap can shorten when a burst occurs, leading to a temporary reduction
 or shift of tonal noise, before coherence rebuilds and tones re-emerge.
 Thus, the study provides a physical explanation for the stochastic behavior
 of slat tones (as observed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and others) by relating it to the intrinsic variability of the cove flow.
 In summary, the dominant slat noise sources were found to be: (1) the unsteady
 shear layer impingement causing aeroacoustic resonance, producing a primary
 tonal noise at the burst frequency and its harmonics, and (2) additional
 broadband contributions from the smaller-scale turbulent structures convected
 through the gap.
 Importantly, no evidence was found of purely artificial acoustic modes
 due to the computational setup – the spanwise cellular pattern was confirmed
 to be a physical feature rather than a numerical artifact, as it persisted
 when varying the spanwise domain length, boundary conditions, and slat
 positioning.
 The variability from no cell formation to wave numbers of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{z}/5$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{z}$
\end_inset

 is the spanwise length provides a validation of the same fact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Surrogate Modeling and Parametric Study:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To extend the analysis beyond a single geometry, a surrogate modeling framework
 was developed to investigate slat noise across a range of slat positions.
 Using a Gaussian Process (GP) regression as the surrogate, coupled with
 an active learning strategy (Upper Confidence Bound, UCB), the study explored
 a three-dimensional parameter space of slat gap, overlap, and deflection
 angle, i.e.
 positions relative to the main element.
 The use of a statistical surrogate model has the objective of maximizing
 the sampling efficiency for the parametric simulation, and also to introduce
 such methods to aeroacoustic engineering research.
 The surrogate model was trained on a limited set of high-fidelity LBM simulatio
ns and was able to predict the noise spectra for any intermediate slat setting,
 along with an estimate of its own uncertainty.
 This approach was also presented as an optimization tool: the UCB-driven
 sampling iteratively selected new simulation cases that were pinned to
 case that maximize the far-field noise, thereby honing in on the loudest
 configurations.
 As a result, the most acoustically critical slat setting in the considered
 design space was identified with far fewer runs than a naive parameter
 sweep.
 The surrogate’s predictions of sound pressure levels were in close agreement
 with subsequent LBM simulations for those noisiest configurations, demonstratin
g the model’s utility and the benefit of uncertainty-based sampling.
 Beyond optimization, this parametric campaign yielded a rich dataset that
 allowed us to examine the generality of the cove flow phenomena: indeed,
 the spanwise cell formation and bursting mechanism were observed across
 all tested slat positions, though the exact frequency and strength of the
 bursts showed some dependence on slat geometry.
 For instance, moving the slat outboard (increasing gap and overlap) tended
 to slightly alter the recirculation size and shift the burst frequency,
 but the qualitative behavior remained the same.
 These observations confirm that the centrifugal-instability-driven unsteadiness
 is an inherent feature of slat cove flows.
 In summary, the surrogate modeling effort not only facilitated rapid evaluation
 of slat noise performance for different geometries, but also supported
 the physical analysis by expanding the range of conditions under which
 the newly identified noise mechanism has been validated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, this thesis combined high-fidelity LBM simulations and data-driven
 surrogate modeling to gain new insights into slat noise.
 We have demonstrated that LBM can reliably capture the intricate flow physics
 and acoustics of a leading-edge slat, provided sufficient care in its numerical
 setup.
 The discovery of the spanwise cellular instability and its role in modulating
 the noise generation is a key scientific contribution, offering a deeper
 mechanistic understanding of slat noise that bridges previously disparate
 observations (tone interactions, intermittency, etc.).
 Meanwhile, the surrogate modeling approach represents a step towards practical
 aeroacoustic design optimization, showing how costly simulations can be
 leveraged in an intelligent manner to explore design changes.
 The tools and knowledge developed in this work lay a foundation for more
 efficient framework and eventually an aeroacoustic surrogate model applicable
 to real world design problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Future Perspectives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the conclusions of this thesis, several avenues are proposed for future
 work.
 These include immediate next steps that naturally extend the current study,
 as well as long-term research directions that apply emerging techniques
 to the problem of slat noise prediction and reduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Expanded Parametric Studies: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A logical and first next step is to broaden the parameter space investigated
 for slat noise characteristics.
 In this thesis we varied the slat gap and overlap for a fixed airfoil geometry
 – the VALIANT 
\begin_inset ERT
status open
\begin_layout Plain Layout
\backslash textcolor{red}{3-element}
\end_layout
\end_inset
 configuration at a single angle of attack, Mach
 number, and Reynolds number.
 Future studies should consider a more comprehensive parametric sweep, including
 different slat deflection angles, gap sizes, profile shapes, and incoming
 velocity.
 Varying the flow conditions – such as the freestream velocity (Reynolds
 number) or angle of attack of the main wing – would provide insight into
 the scaling of the noise sources.
 Expanding the dataset in these ways would not only enhance the surrogate
 model (making it more general), but also test the limits of the current
 conclusions.
 For instance, it can answer questions like whether the bursting Strouhal
 number remain around 0.16 for other free stream velocities, or does it shift
 with different flow parameters.
 Variation of the Reynolds number can also shed light on whether the strength
 of spanwise modes and its wave number increases as the Reynolds number
 increases, and thus whether such an increased instability explain the complete
 attenuation of tonal noise at flight Reynolds numbers.
 Answering such questions would help generalize the slat noise theory and
 potentially lead to low-order design tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Further Validation and Diagnostics: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although a validation was performed for the baseline case, it would strengthen
 the conclusions to seek additional experimental or high-fidelity data for
 comparison.
 Near-term efforts could involve collaborating with experimental researchers
 to obtain detailed measurements for a few key cases for instance, the loudest
 slat position identified by our surrogate model.
 Comparing measured and simulated far-field spectra, as well as any measured
 flow features, would provide a rigorous test of the new physical insights.
 This could include checking if the predicted burst frequency and spanwise
 mode pattern occur in reality.
 The recent experiments by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "KamliyaJawahar2021"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 on slat noise intermittency, for example, might be re-examined in light
 of our findings to probe whether their wall-pressure traces or acoustic
 spectra show signatures consistent with a recirculation bubble pulsation;
 or whether the characteristics vary along the spanwise directions.
 A targeted experimental campaign on a slat-only configuration could directly
 look for the spanwise cellular flows or the unsteady recirculation bubble
 hypothesized here.
 Validating these flow features is challenging, but indirect evidence could
 support our conclusions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Machine Learning Surrogates with Enhanced Capability: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A major long-term goal is to leverage advanced machine learning (ML) techniques
 to create surrogate models of slat noise that go beyond the limited-parameter
 Gaussian Process model developed here.
 This thesis sets the basic structure and theoretical ideas for it, but
 has implemented the surrogate primarily for Active Learning purposes.
 The same model, if continually trained for further acquisition steps can
 provide a noise surrogate, including for variations of the Reynolds number.
 Moreover, the method can be extended for more complex cases other than
 slat noise by utilizing the same method of feature reductions and representatio
n of spectral data and their uncertainties.
 Finally the stochastic Upper Confidence Bound acquisition function that
 we deployed is only one among many possible techniques, which are also
 evolving in their own literature.
 An upgradation using a more optimal acquisition function for sampling will
 be highly beneficial for industrial use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Integration into Design and Noise Mitigation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the long run, the insights and tools developed here can be directed towards
 practical noise reduction strategies for high-lift devices.
 One vision is to incorporate the surrogate model (enhanced by ML as discussed
 above) into a multi-objective optimization framework for aircraft design.
 For example, an optimizer could adjust the slat geometry or deployment
 angle to minimize noise, perhaps aiming to disrupt the coherence or reduce
 the strength of the cove instabilities, while still meeting lift and aerodynami
c requirements.
 The fast evaluation provided by a surrogate model would make it feasible
 to explore a vast design space and identify novel configurations or add-on
 devices such as slat cove fillers or serrated slat cusps that achieve a
 better noise-performance trade-off.
 Any promising designs coming out of such computational optimization could
 then be validated by targeted high-fidelity simulations and experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Extending High-Fidelity Simulations: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As computing power continues to grow, it will become increasingly feasible
 to apply high-fidelity methods like LBM to more complex and realistic scenarios
, which is another long-term avenue.
 Future researchers could build on this work by simulating a full wing with
 both slat and flap in deployed position, or a complete aircraft landing
 configuration, capturing the interplay between multiple noise sources (slat,
 flap, landing gear, etc.).
 While today this would be enormously demanding, trends in GPU-based computing
 and algorithmic improvements (e.g.
 adaptive mesh refinement in LBM, better boundary conditions, coupling with
 Large-Eddy Simulation turbulence models for finer near-wall resolution)
 may bring such computations within reach.
 These simulations would validate whether the noise mechanisms identified
 in an isolated slat hold in the presence of other components and whether
 new noise source interactions emerge.
 They could also provide high-fidelity data to guide standards and regulations
 by virtually testing noise abatement scenarios.
 In summary, the long-term trajectory of this research field will likely
 see a convergence of data-driven models and intensive simulations: the
 former (ML surrogates) will rapidly explore design changes and hypotheses,
 while the simulation tools like LBM as a next-generation high-fidelity
 simulation method will verify and deepen our understanding, each feeding
 into the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In closing, the work accomplished in this thesis, in our expectations, has
 laid a groundwork for statistical surrogate methodology in aeroacoustic
 design and augmented the physical insights for addressing slat noise.
 By amalgamating an advanced CFD approach (LBM) with modern surrogate modeling,
 we have shown a pathway to analyze, predict, and possibly mitigate the
 complex noise generated by high-lift devices.
 The method is also generalisable to other aeroacoustic cases where complex
 industrial geometries need to be studied parametrically but where each
 experimentation is computationally expensive.
 Finally, the findings on the flow dynamics and aeroacoustic mechanisms
 that we presented not only assist in solving pieces of the long-standing
 puzzle of slat noise dynamics, but also open the door to innovative research
 directions.
 Continued efforts along the lines described will bring us closer to the
 goals of deeper scientific understanding and practical noise reduction,
 contributing to the broader aim of more environmentally sustainable aviation.
